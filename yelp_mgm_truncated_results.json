Let me start with our arrival.  Staff was friendly, place is clean, covid rules enforced.  Definitely on point (I'm obviously not big on the covid thing since I'm in Vegas, but nice to see they were following orders from the government) and appreciative to see it.  Bags were delivered to our room within 10 minutes of us calling on them so we were off to a good start.  I'll share a quick video of the room since I don't remember the name, but the room was dope, huge patio with a TV and a Vegas view that if you're only visiting here once, I'd recommend one of these rooms.  You pretty much get it all.  Those are all the upsides.  Downside, first night; we get back late and being in Vegas, non cigarette smokers, and myself personally being an asthmatic, we couldn't wait for the shower.  Also, being as how I drank because it was my birthday, I assumed a shower and water weren't something I'd have to worry about but no water at all.  Upon calling the front desk, we were told there is nothing they could do and to take all the water in the fridge and at that point, we knew the hotel was most likely struggling so made the best of it.  Well that didn't work either.  On everything at 1AM the sounds of pipes clanging started.  Even though I drank for my birthday, it was damn near impossible to sleep.  We called the desk again and they informed us there is nothing they can do, so we took it and slept as much as we could and just turned some TV on loud to try and diffuse the noise.  Well day 2 (day after my sleepless birthday) we went to the event we came into town for, luckily showered, and had a good time after considering the room was definitely set up to have company.  Again, although the room has obviously been weathered over the years, it shows nice, and it's large balcony area is amazing and accommodating.  Well, when everyone left, guess what happened again?  THE NOISE.  I know in the real world we are fortunate enough to be able to afford spaces like these, and I should be thankful, but honestly even though the room was only $900 a night, I feel like we should at least get some sleep because really that's part of renting a space that is at a place like the MGM right?  Well the people were very nice on the phone, but we were met with answers like \"We are short staffed\" and then again at about 3:30AM that it might no be pipes but something blowing in the wind on the unit above us but they didn't have anyone who could go up to look.  Well 5 calls in, we gave up.  Tired as we could be we just grabbed coffee and made the best of it knowing MGM has always taken care of our parents when they brought us here growing up, and knowing we called over 8 times trying to resolve the situation that maybe we'd be comped or something....... well........ NONE OF THAT.  Had this been me 10 years back:  I probably would've lost my shit and made a scene, but now, I'm just going to make sure y'all see this warning.  MGM might be struggling, but we were treated like nobodies because maybe we didn't press the issue.  Upon telling the guy on checkout, we were given a free Red Bull.  This post isn't about anything other then warning you, MGM isn't back thru this covid thing enough to care if the rooms are going to suit your needs.  They are so broken that if there happens to be an issue, they don't have the time or manpower to fix it, and probably not the money to anyways.  I usually don't add up what I do or pay when I go to places, but we easily spent 6-7K on our 2 day trip at MGM and their restaurants (Tom's Steakhouse and the Japanese Waygu and the Ribs are a must)  and I am sad I ever bothered.  The fact thay we were treated like nobodies was comical, but sad at the same time knowing the people we were asking for help, literally couldn't do anything about it.", "lang_code": "en", "author_avatar": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/_wINXsAEkRa5itIflT8tNw/60s.jpg", "author_url": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RUH37My2DlUco8Krox2Qjg", "author_name": "Aaron F.", "meta_data": {"author_contributions": 129, "feedback": {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}}, "location": "San Lorenzo, CA", "response": null}, {"review_url": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mgm-grand-hotel-las-vegas-5?hrid=CqYb8bNO-2zTITi3YrSfMQ", "id": "CqYb8bNO-2zTITi3YrSfMQ", "date": "2021-04-20", "rating": 5, "review_title": "", "review_text": "I want to give a special shout out to the Hotel Manager's Jake & Ryan.

Hubs & I honeymooned here back in 2014. We just finally made it back a couple weeks ago. Woo! We traveled with a big group, but most of us had rooms close together. My parents booked a strip view, so they were up a different bank of elevators. This was kind of a pain, since my kids were back and forth so much! If you're in a group I recommend all similar rooms and ask for closer. With the requirement for a key to access the correct elevators it just adds some complications. Covid protocol was really solid. Security in the elevator area to enforce masks, as well as throughout the casino. You can smoke, eat, or drink with it off, but then pull it back up after each drink. We reserved chairs at the pool, which I HIGHLY recommend you do. Especially while capacity limits are lower. It was not well marked where to go to get to the middle of the river, but after walking back and forth past a guy posted up at a gate (he didn't look like an employee or I would have asked sooner!) I finally made it. Ha! We floated the lazy river and really enjoyed having a spot to leave our stuff or relax. Masks are not required while in the pool, walking to/from the pool, eating, or drinking. You can purchase tubes for $20-$25 each. They do refill them for free if you bring them back. One of ours popped after day 1, so they replaced it. We had really great service both days too! The server came around frequently and quickly brought menus to us. Drinks were all good, but very expensive. Food was perfect pool food for the kids and grown kids alike! It was windy while we were there, so the umbrellas had to stay down. I still enjoy the MGM, but having the monorail down made it SO FAR from everything else. The strip just past it (toward Planet Hollywood) has become really different... it felt more run down than any of us had seen in the past.

ANd, if you wait until the line goes down, actually you can't because if you don't show up and wait in line before 11am, they sell your cabana to someone else and keep your money.Yes, Covid regulations make it hard but many places that are usually crowed have online reservation systems that let guests book time slots, that are respectful and considerate to the public.Not this greedy and horribly run hotel.

Know it wasn't the wife so I don't bring it up. I'm gaining wisdom in my old age!!I do know one time when I stayed with my wife, we dined at Rainforest Cafe, which used to be here. She wore one of her ao dai, which is why I remember. (Yes, mail order bride. Postage was.... excessive!)It's a great hotel for many reasons, but for me it doesn't quite have a defined personality. But, it has great restaurants, shows, etc, etc....  It's always worth a visit when in town for a few days, or you could of course just stay here.

Housekeeping will come to your room in the middle of the night 6 hours after you've asked for your sheets to be changed because they were dirty when you checked in. I really wish I could give them less than one star. I'll get the easy part out of the way. The pros for this hotel are that it is on the strip and on the Saturday night that we stayed there they had complimentary parking.This stay was terrible. We checked in at about 9pm after driving in from Los Angeles. They have a large parking garage but you have to lug all of your stuff all the way through the casino to get to the front desk. If they had luggage carts I wasn't able to locate one. Check in was pretty quick and easy. We get up to our room and drop our bags. First thing I always do is check the beds to make sure they're clean and make sure that we have enough towels for everyone. One bed was fine but the other had holes in the sheets and there was a what looked like buggers on one of the pillows. I called down to the front desk and they said they would send someone up to change the bedding right away. We started getting ready to head out to eat. After about 30 minutes nobody came so we left to get food and walk the strip. We assumed that they would come while we were out. We got back in at about 1am and stopped at the front desk for towels because I forgot to ask for them on my initial call. I didn't ask about the sheets because I just assumed they had already been changed. We get up to the room and the sheets were still dirty. I called the front desk a few times and nobody answered. The towels arrived a few minutes after we requested them, we showered and went to bed. We decided to put the dirty pillow on the floor and sleep on the sheets because even though they had holes in them, they appeared to be clean. At around 2:15am the front desk calls and says that housekeeping is at the door and is ready to change our sheets. AT 2 IN THE MORNING. I decline because I'm not waking up my kids to get the sheets changed almost 6 hours after I initially made the request. In the morning we are waiting for the elevator so we can head down and check out. There are 6 elevators on this wing and 3 aren't working. You can hear them ding but the doors don't open. The other 3 will only let you go up. 2 of us get on one elevator and 2 of us catch the next one. The elevator goes up and stops on every floor on the way and then does the same thing on the way back down. It even stopped on a floor that didn't have an access button in our elevator. After that fiasco I stand in line to check out. I explain to the front desk lady what happened and ask how they can make it right. She goes and talks to her manager. They claim they can't discount the room because I booked through a third party but they waive the resort fee and they offer us a $50 dining credit. I'm not happy about not being able to adjust the room fee but ok. We ask where can a family of 4 eat in the casino for $50 or less and they say there are a couple places. We go to the cheapest restaurant in the casino and the meals are still about $20pp. We opted for Starbucks because that HAS to feed 4 people for less than $50 right...? WRONG! We end up about $9 over. I head back up to the front desk to ask for the rest of the breakfast to be comped and the lady that helped me this time says I shouldn't ask for anything else and I should be happy with what I've already been given...WHAT!? I'm in the twilight zone now. We go back and forth and she eventually gets her manager after she said that my request was declined. There was some kind of miscommunication between the employee and the manager because the manager thought I was asking for an additional $59 instead of just the $9. They ended up comping the rest of the breakfast and we left.

I applaud that! The bellman Martin and Herb for taking my bags up and back down to the lobby, thank for your professionalism. To the gracious, mature curly blonde hair cocktails waitress on late March 20, Saturday into Sunday AM (didn't get her name), we had a pleasant conversation and made each other laugh, memorable, thank you. To the housekeeper (slim Jamaican man I believe) he came to change the aroma therapy diffuser, thank you as well.Now overall the property has done fairly good job of keeping up the modern look. Casino games were all there to enjoy. I definitely feel I have graduated to next level of MLife properties, as I feel this property is quickly falling back with its sister property Excalibur and Luxor which I would never stay at again.The clientele at MGM is tough to watch, I witnessed a family with two toddlers on the casino floor in a red wagon at 1130pm, frat boy walking around in a white bathrobe, gangster types, guests dressed in gym/basketball shorts and dirty T-shirts, a lot of loitering around slots. Now, I get it,  hotels are hurting financially and cannot discriminate. But they could have a dress code at minimum on casino floor. Dressing with class needs to be restored in LV, most of clientele at MGM did not appear to care, in my view. Maybe depends on the weekend events. Overall I understand that's not MGM's job to police.We stayed in the Stay Well Marquee Suite on 15 floor (mountain facing/airport), this was an absolute refuge from the craziness of the casino and other guests. We hung out in this comfortable, modern suite, view of the mountains, watched sunrise come over the mountain range at 630am, it was awesome! You see the whole airport but do not hear any airplane noise. It was fabulous! From my room there is partial view of the Strip. You can see video reviews of this suite online. The only difference is ours had a pool table. Cues included, some missing tips. Not sure if all Stay Well Marquee Suites have that.Few issues, one was with aroma therapy \"Ascent\" diffuser, I barely, if at all,  could smell the scent even after the housekeeping changed the cartridge. I'm big on aroma therapy and was looking forward to that experience. Another small issue the bathtub had no plug so I could not soak. Last you have to bring an aux jack connection to play you music through their stereo speakers (there was one for sale in the room), I was not aware of that prior to arrival. Remember this is a big hotel so, I understand their probably not fully staffed at this time, so when I called front desk, housekeeping, bell stand, there was a longer than normal hold times when I called from the suite room phone.Overall the room was a haven, curtains opened and closed with push of a button. 4 TVs, plenty of comfortable seating. Bed and pillows were top notch, had good sleep all three nights! Full stock fridge, but we brought our own drinks and snacks (esp with $18 bottles of water, no joke). Stay Well air filter was fantastic and I felt it worked well, loved that! Three port stations, one in each bedroom and one in the living room part of suite. They gave us antibac and masks, but we brought our own, but loved the touch. \"Energizing light\" and Vitamin D diffuser in shower both were a pleasant feature. Robes were plush! Bvlgari products in the bathrooms, quality bathroom products. Keyless entry onto elevator and front door of suite from Mlife app.If you're an MGM fan, definitely hit this room up, it's worth the money, especially if you want to watch sporting events privately. There was two of us we each had a room. The cliental is not the MGM's fault, but I think it's time to upgrade my hotel experience next time. Most likely will stay within the Mlife properties.

I've heard mixed reviews but we decided to try it out for a staycation. I've been coming to the casino for over a decade and to be honest it frustrated me. I ALWAYS got lost lol. With that being said this is an iconic Las Vegas hotel. A little ways from center strip but it is walkable for most people. With tons of food options and a HUGE casino you really don't have to leave, if your a millionaire. The nice thing is you have some cheaper food options just an Uber ride away. The room was very clean and spacious, better than NY NY. I think the number one reason to stay at MGM Grand is the pool area. It was themed well and there was plenty of space. It seemed very slow for a Sunday but that wasn't a bad thing! We scored a spot right along the lazy river which is AMAZING. The lazy river is extra lazy, very very slow, BUT it was wonderful. I highly recommend bringing your own intertube however you can purchase them on property. It was very uncomfortable walking the lazy river for 3 hours... We ordered lunch and beers. $80 dollars for steak nachos and 6 beers. Would have been the same price in the casino MINUS the Nachos. Overall this may be my second favorite MGM property pool. Mandalay first, this one did not disappoint though. The lazy river is large and you can pull up a chair right alongside it. You are not allowed to be stationary in the river, you have to keep moving. They are sort of on your ass about everything here. It was annoying but I know these people are just doing there jobs. Overall it was a great experience.

Overall, the staff was friendly and helpful. They had a hard time locating my reservation but it was eventually found in their system under my bf's name. It was a weird  situation. Another thing...they let us check in earlier than 3 pm without an extra cost. You have to pay some tourist tax fee of over a hundred dollars. I knew about that already. Another thing I didn't like was that they took out a $300 deposit in case we buy water or snacks in the room or...I guess end up destroying it. There are also sodas and alcohol in the fridge. The thing doesn't even open! I'm not willing to pay $18 for a bottle of a water. There's a CVS and Walgreens down the street. There's also a vending machine in the hallway. The water and snacks are $3 and change there. Luckily, I'll be getting that deposit back.The room was spacious and comfy enough for us. I don't need a lot of amenities or extravagant things, especially when I'm out gambling, eating, etc. most of the time. It was just a basic room with two comfy queen size beds, the usual stuff. The walls are a little bit thin, though. My neighbors all around were probably in their early 20's and partying it up. They were loud and most likely drunk at 2 or 3 am.

I'll try to keep this as to the point as possible : I included photos of a few spots we were able to hit during Covid since mostly everything is closed or has limited seating. From MGM you can actually walk through the casino floor and out the back of the hotel to the Las Vegas Strip. We didn't know there was a shortcut until we had walked the longer way three times and had taken 2 taxi trips. These photos are places that are within walking distance from the MGM Hotel on the strip. From MGM to the strip you will pay about $11-$15 with a tip via Taxi. There are no shuttles right now. So rent a car if you don't want to do the walking thing. If it's nice weather we recommend walking because the traffic isn't the best. There is still a bus but I didn't want to ride inside of a closed bus that was FULL. The room: Was terrible. The furniture was old and worn. The bathroom had rust in more than one place. The sink AND shower did not drain so between showers we literally had to wait for the water to go down. Carpet wasn't the cleanest and the mini fridge was HOT to touch. We had to call down to the front desk for more than one reason (I'll get to that). We had a 4 day stay ... they gave us 1 set of towels for two people and when I asked for more we were given 2. We shower everyday.. not sure about others but mmmk, We had to call down because the thermostat was on 80 and blowing cold air like a motel 6. Whew. Two doors down we witnessed a domestic violence situation. Called for help since I thought .. maybe the female would be murdered and they put me on hold... after I told them what was going on THEY CALLED THE ROOM as opposed to coming to see what was going ON. So, I'm sure he was smothering her while he talked to the front desk and told them everything was ok. We left (I was so scared to leave her there but I mean I can't get involved in domestic disputes .. innocent bystanders get killed trying to help) WHEN WE RETURNED she was on the phone in the hallway nude. If you are looking for a young crowd that's rolling around the hotel in handicapped carts and screaming.. playing tag.. I mean.. you found the right place! We are all for a good time but .. not like this. You can tell they room all of the same kind of people in the same parts or the hotel .. it's obvious. The room service bill for breakfast was about $100 for two people . I had steak, potatoes and eggs with a mimosa.. 3 stars and that's because of the alcohol otherwise 1. My husband had pancakes, sausage etc traditional breakfast and enjoyed his meal. There is a Hooters across the street you can get food at for dinner if needed. Everything in Vegas requires a reservation because of Covid and the capacity limitations so call and book ahead and make sure you use a \"good last name\" (read between the lines) because if not ... \"we are full\" is all you will hear. Masks were worn on the strip for the most part unless people were smoking or drinking of course. You will see people with the tall slushy drinks you can get them at the daiquiri shop or Fat Tuesday. Fat Tuesday is cheaper . You purchase the size you want and can add shots for an extra $2-$3 per shot. There is a chick fil a on the strip. If you like cheese on your food keep walking because they don't have it. Planet Hollywood was cool to walk through nothing major - again all the restaurants need reservations or you can wait to be seated. I hope this review helped. We will probably stay at the Bellacio next time - IF we come back.. won't be for as long. Oh there's a lit part of the strip that's busy..music.. drinks.. lots of ppl.. Target.. Marshall's.. Ross.. across from your LV, Gucci etc.. that was fun .. lol Overall- all things considered WE had a great time because when you go with great people you always find fun things to do.", "lang_code": "en", "author_avatar": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/zlP8a1_iqd4mn1UgK21mng/60s.jpg", "author_url": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=FagByacs4FyOnI6k7d7dTw", "author_name": "Tionna D.", "meta_data": {"author_contributions": 6, "feedback": {"useful": 6, "funny": 4, "cool": 2}}, "location": "Irving, TX", "response": null}, {"review_url": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mgm-grand-hotel-las-vegas-5?hrid=we9u5qoOF77vwnBjEEwokA", "id": "we9u5qoOF77vwnBjEEwokA", "date": "2021-02-21", "rating": 1, "review_title": "", "review_text": "Unfortunately my stay was less than pleasant.

The next morning I was able to get coffee at Johnny Rockets who also does breakfast which was a relief since most of the starbucks except for 1 was totally shut down.

Now I believe had I been a white Caucasian client I honestly felt like such a simple request could've been handled with some sensitivity and some professionalism I have never felt more racially violated than in this era we live in now. This gentleman came off to me as an ardent Trump supporter, he was disrespectful and condescending. It is a shame in 2020 that we spend as much money as we do I had a grand king and had walked all over this humongous hotel looking for ice, one of the staff members had the nerve to tell me to catch a cab and go to CVS and get some.It's sad to have such a beautiful property that they lack professionalism and courtesy towards clients especially in a time when the economy is not being friendly to businesses you would think that they would take extra care of the people that they service. But it's going to have to start at the top by making sure that all people are created equal and treated equally with the same kind of service as other people get. #Racist", "lang_code": "en", "author_avatar": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "author_url": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WACCIHVrzBcNxPrfZ5etuQ", "author_name": "Jay Nathan T.", "meta_data": {"author_contributions": 3, "feedback": {"useful": 1, "funny": 7, "cool": 1}}, "location": "San Francisco, CA", "response": null}, {"review_url": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mgm-grand-hotel-las-vegas-5?hrid=phFDVASIxXy5J1aYho4GAA", "id": "phFDVASIxXy5J1aYho4GAA", "date": "2021-01-08", "rating": 5, "review_title": "", "review_text": "We booked this hotel off of orbitz and had a wonderful experience.

We came for the Christmas weekend, and knowing full well the COVID restrictions and concerns throughout the country, I have to say the MGM took great care to keep all things sanitized & safe for all. The rooms (we had two) were clean, restaurants at 25% capacity so definitely social distancing observed, everyone with masks, and continuous cleaning by staff. Courtesy was exceptional from the bell desk to the front desk to the housekeeping & engineering service. When we had a little blip of tv service, engineering came right up, took care of the problem, and an extra courtesy was extended that more than made up for the inconvenience. So if you are hesitating, or thinking about a weekend getaway from the stresses of your home reality, I highly encourage you to consider the MGM Grand for your stay.

After a night of slots (not one server came to us to offer us drinks after spending a few hundred dollars), we went up to our room and decided we wanted some cocktails but we wanted to stay in for the night. We had sodas in the room but they weren't cold because the refrigerator in the room wouldn't open, which we told hotel staff about and they didn't fix it. So I went down our hallway to grab a soda from the vending machine. I went to every single vending machine on our floor and all they had was water and vitamin water. The rest were completely empty. So I went back to my room to order room service. They said after 2 pm room service was unavailable. Which is surprising especially since it is Vegas. I then asked if someone could bring us up some sodas and I would pay any additional fee, they would not accommodate us.

After this long 5 day stay, i can confidently say this would not be my hotel of choice.  It is definitely a nice hotel and very large but here is my experience at MGM...  Check-in process was very quick and easy.  $200 refundable deposit is required as well as daily resort fees. Which for 5 days was about another $200.Upon checking in, we were told we had a $20 dining credit per day to spend at a hotel restaurant in MGM. You scan a barcode at the front desk that pulls up a list of what is supposed to be eligible restaurants.  Welp we found that is not the case, most of the restaurants are closed and then the other half are third party and can't charge to the room (that's how we had to use the dining credit) so we got to use the credit one day and that was it. So pretty pointless and not really explained well at the front desk.   Even though the hotel is extremely large it seemed they were only checking in guests on floors 21-29 and not really utilizing the other floors. I say this because once the weekend came, the wait to just get on the elevators  was 10-20 minutes because there were so many people trying to get up at the same time.  Meanwhile the elevators to the other floors were empty so not sure what was up with that.  The room was large and clean.  The hotel even leaves a mask and sanitation kit in the room.  Mini bar was open and fully stocked. Masks are required pretty much at every single moment. My mask wasn't covering just the tip of my nose and i got asked to pull it up.  They are not playing around at all.   For me, location is everything.  I like to stay centralized on The Strip because everything is right there and can easily walk to any place on the strip and go back to your room at anytime.   Well MGM is literally soooo far down the strip and on those late drunk nights it is not fun to walk all the way back to your hotel.  It's about a good 30 minute walk from the heart of the strip so we did way more walking than usual this time around.", "lang_code": "en", "author_avatar": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/--G1wNCjuGtcASSE7Fnqnw/60s.jpg", "author_url": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=2TnNuDng2jujtNTuHHNoKg", "author_name": "Kris B.", "meta_data": {"author_contributions": 239, "feedback": {"useful": 6, "funny": 4, "cool": 2}}, "location": "The Colony, TX", "response": null}, {"review_url": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mgm-grand-hotel-las-vegas-5?hrid=CpKR5BOwGSb1IJsbhwNFXg", "id": "CpKR5BOwGSb1IJsbhwNFXg", "date": "2020-11-27", "rating": 1, "review_title": "", "review_text": "Checked with self check in, located our room.

Places that are listed as open (Cabana Grill) are in fact NOT open and you won't know that until you walk the mile to get there...  no one can tell you and the website may SAY a place is open but it isn't.There also isn't much to see at MGM Grand.  Our room was fine - comfy bed and nice spa tub.  The slot machine selection is OK.   I did find that their drink service while you're playing is very good.  Probably the best at any of the MGM properties I stay at.  Room service is more readily available but very pricey - a $9 charge for any order and the menu is pretty limited.

Explanation coming but if you read nothing else read this: This hotel is NOT covid safe AT ALL. Their AC cycles air from room to room. We had an employee confirm this after our room smelled like smoke, but we don't smoke, and it didn't smell like smoke when we arrived to it. If cigarette smoke can travel from room to room...so can covid. On to the review. We booked 3 nights. Saturday, our last night of our stay, was free. So we arrived on Thursday night to a parking lot that reeked of cigarette smoke, a lobby that smelled like old hotel, and a front desk person that literally took 35 minutes to tally up and charge us for 3 resort fees. Why it took that long I'll never know. She told us the hotel is non smoking in the rooms. We don't smoke so all good. We finally get to room 1 and it REEKS of cigarette smoke. I don't have a good sense of smell and it was overwhelming for me. Called the front desk and they explained it goes from room to room through the AC system. Great. Now I'm worried about covid but they offer us another room. They recode the keys and we head to the floor below. Our keys aren't working with the elevator anymore. Spend another half hour at the desk fixing the keys. Then we arrive to the second room and no cigarette smell. Great. However, the room is old, dirty, and needs updating. Dust still on the window sill, burnt edges on the mirrors, stained couch, chipped furniture, and sunflower seeds on the floor. Clearly this hotel hasn't had any work done since opening in 93, and isn't cleaned well either. More reason for nervousness with covid. So we sanitized everything and went to bed. Woke up in the morning and the room smelled like cigarette smoke. Again, we don't smoke. So while we're out we decide to cancel our free Saturday night and cash in on a comp night at another hotel. That's right. We cancelled a free night. But we still had to stay Friday night.So we go out for the afternoon and when we get back the room smells even worse of cigarettes. It's a giant ashtray at this point. To top it off there is a loud buzzing that sounds like a vacuum going non stop. We assume it's cleaners next door. GF takes a nap for 40 minutes and wakes up to still buzzing so she calls the front desk who says they will send up maintenance. I didn't want anyone in the room but us and then I went to listen and realized it was the AC that sounded like a vacuum.  I call the front desk and ask for a refund of the resorts fees to which they agreed. They offered a third room change. I reluctantly agreed. While I'm on the phone we get a knock at the door. Probably maintenance since they sent them up. Open the door and it's a security Guard. They sent up security not maintenance. I said we were good, closed the door, and had had enough. We packed, paid for a room at another hotel even though we paid for last night at mgm, and we booked it. I will NEVER go back to mgm grand. Horrible service, dirty, and a covid death trap.

I booked this trip to celebrate my boyfriend and my anniversary, because I've heard great reviews, but overall, I don't think I would stay there again.When we were checking in, I asked about our $50 food & beverage credit, and the woman at the front desk gave us a helpful slip listing the restaurants where we could use the credit; she also mentioned that room service & pool service were included, so we were quite frustrated to find out at the end of the stay that it wasn't part of the \"food & beverage credit\" package....After check in, we were given our room keys and we went up to the room. The room seemed fine at first, but as we started to get settled in, we noticed lots of problems; the TV wasn't working, the phone wasn't working, the shower floor was super dirty, and the shampoo & conditioner in the shower were used (the seals were broken and they looked dirty on the outside). We were so freaking tired from our trip and we just wanted food ASAP so we tried to call room service to use our food and beverage credit (jokes on us- apparently room service isn't included in the credit even though we were told it was, but we only found that out at checkout) and we couldn't reach the kitchen so we called on our cell phone. When someone finally picked up, they said we had to call from a hotel phone. We said \"we are in the hotel in our room, but our phone isn't working\" and they just hung up on us! So unprofessional!We went down to the front desk to convey our frustrations and they told us we could switch rooms, which we (of course) happily did. When we got to the new room the TV was working and the phone was working, but the light on my boyfriend's side of the bed kept turning on and off periodically without us touching the light switch, which was so annoying when we were trying to sleep. Also, the bed didn't have a sheet cover, which was so gross and it made it difficult for me to sleep soundly; our mattress was straight up exposed underneath the main sheet.... YUCK! SO unsanitary!! I just kept thinking about all the people who had slept on that bed & all the kids who have wet the bed on that mattress; there was no mattress cover to protect us from those germs! -----Fun fact: Most hotels keep their mattresses for 3-7 years so with 365 days in the year and with the beds being occupied on average 2/3 of the year (but most likely even more prior to COVID 19 times), that's 243 days per year (times 3 years is 730 days!)!! That's 243 days per year for the mattress to collect skin cells, body fluids, etc. and without a mattress cover, those skin cells & body fluids are just getting absorbed into the mattress!!!! I mean you never want to see the bare mattress in a hotel especially if the mattress isn't even clean/new and I could tell it was old because of the stains!! It's really unsanitary to have guests sleeping straight on the mattress.I really enjoyed the casino staff, but the hotel staff left much to be desired. During both check in and check out- the attendants weren't smiling much and seemed to have some attitude. As someone who works in the customer service industry, I thought it was bizarre. Especially since the front desk is the first and last interaction that guests have with the business- it should be a positive one.....Also, as I already mentioned, the kitchen hung up on us when we tried to order room service from our cell phone (because our hotel phone wasn't working), which I didn't appreciate.I really didn't like the room itself, but since we had already requested to move, I didn't want to move again. The carpet was sticky and hard in the corner by the mirror/TV, the bed didn't have a mattress cover (again-YUCK!), the bathroom door didn't fully close, and the shower floor was rather grimy.", "lang_code": "en", "author_avatar": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/UGPXrCVySdeZJRezdmxjuw/60s.jpg", "author_url": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Syfe9T6ZPTvOfcmQ0Bjwwg", "author_name": "Olivia S.", "meta_data": {"author_contributions": 14, "feedback": {"useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 0}}, "location": "San Bruno, CA", "response": null}, {"review_url": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mgm-grand-hotel-las-vegas-5?hrid=t7lsCDUkHSv5KinacOj87A", "id": "t7lsCDUkHSv5KinacOj87A", "date": "2020-09-11", "rating": 4, "review_title": "", "review_text": "It is a very large hotel that seems a little out dated , I stay at another property nearby that is more geared towards my tastes..

My family and I traveled the 4 hour drive to MGM never staying there before we had heard great things so we wanted to try this hotel. Day 1 after the long drive we finally get to our room after waiting 40 minutes in registration line to get keys which ok Covid less staff I understand but then the hellish nightmare begins. We get into our room finally and our AC is literally blowing out hot air and I mean hot so we call front desk where a woman tells us we have to wait for a work order to be placed so we sit in heat ok bad first impression we wait over an hour on our vacation in our hot freaking room until finally we get upset enough to call front desk again. 15 minutes later finally what must have been a maintenance man about the same age as Father Time knocks at our door comes in and just stares at the unit as if he had no clue what he needed to do mind you family vacation old man trying to fix unit kicking in the vent cover because he couldn't get it on right after just opening a vent further and using a brush to clean the unit. Ok we decide to go out and the man tells us it's fixed and it should work he says should ??? So we get back to room rather late first night in Vegas come back to a hot and I mean hot room at 1 am we call down and request a room change or someone to come back and fix it so our journey begins we go downstairs to speak with Manager a comic book collecting living at home with mom still kinda ass hole who apparently has no idea what manager means but I will get to that later. He gives us a new room and states oh it's a slight upgrade so we are like ok he's trying to make it right this ass hole gives us the wrong room number however when we get to the floor the bell hop is sitting in front of entirely different room number and tells us oh this is the room they told me so we try to open the door after being told room keys transfer but of course keys don't work so at 1:30 am we are walking back downstairs across hotel just to get a freaking key from asshole again who apparently thinks he's a manager. We finally get that taken care of after an hour of walking hotel at 1:30 am in the morning this same manager tells us oh I'm so sorry let me give you a 100 dollar credit to be used ANYWHERE IN Hotel wrong again guys couldn't use it at all this room was about a 1000 bucks and he gives us a 100 dollar credit REALLY !!!! So finally smooth sailing or at least we thought . We call 4 different times for our luggage to be picked up as we sit and wait for over another hour to have our luggage brought downstairs. Seriously people HOSPITALITY apparently is not a word this organization can define , comprehend , or even understand STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL AND PRAY THAT THEY LOOSE ENOUGH MONEY DURING THIS PANDEMIC THAT SOMEONE WILL BUY THEM OUT . These people have absolutely no business running a hotel in Vegas  find some educated people to run this place and maybe just maybe you might have a chance in the future. If I was treated this poorly how many others experienced the same thing . Thank you for ruining my family's vacation MGM or should I say Shit Hole Palace  you guys did an amazing job of ruining my daughters  21st  birthday I truly hope you go bankrupt find some real owners who actually RUN THEIR CASINO hell even the MOB organized crime lords understand HOSPITALITY YEAH THEY MIGHT BREAK A FINGER OR TWO LOL BUT THEY AT LEAST CARED ABOUT THEIR GUESTS !!!

I call the front desk to make sure I won't get charged, and they tell me they have to do an \"investigation\" before they can assure I won't get charged. Investigate what? The food never came, Sharlene in the kitchen (who I talked to each time I called) just stated she never even put in the order. Then to top it all off they even tried to charge my tip for food I never RECEIVED. STAY AWAY unless you have money to waste.Update: Charlene (manager) ended up getting everything resolved and the order taken off. She apologized that it took so long.

We booked online (Expedia or Priceline- don't remember) & stayed at MGM. Prior to- we were a little concerned over the pool situation. Some folks were saying it's first come, first serve & others were saying book chairs or a cabana or you won't get in. Since I knew there would be no shows or clubs open - being at the pool was vital. So I booked lounge chairs for Saturday & cabanas for Sunday & Monday. Although pretty spendy to book- it was worth it. I didn't have to stress over trying to find chairs or somewhere to put stuff down. Saturday & Sunday were extremely busy. So much so, they had two check-ins & waiting lists for those that didn't make it in before 10am. Yes! 10am...by that time they were reaching full capacity (1/2 due to COVID) & you would need to get on a wait list. Hence if you have reservations you don't have to worry about that. The staff were super friendly... Especially our assigned Cabana staff- Byron & Gary. Those fellas did awesome & were super helpful & very personable! As far as the hotel. Yes they had masks, hand sanitizers available everywhere.  Some restaurants were closed, which was a bummer. So we left to other areas to eat. One thing that really bothered me was the constant smell of marijuana. Although there are signs discouraging from smoking it, there is nothing in place to stop it- I must say that I gladly wore my mask to help with the MJ smell. Lastly they had mobile check in. We tried doing it because we preferred that option, but the system could not find our reservation, so we had to stand in line & get key cards. Which was no big deal since it only took about 15min. But if you can do mobile check in I would highly recommend. Also not sure how new this feature is, but one thing I noticed is that your key card only takes you to your floor & the lobby. So if you get on the elevator & don't have key card you can't even ride up to your floor unless you get lucky & the person next to you is going to the same floor. I kind of like this added safety feature. All in all not the same Vegas, but we made it work.

We arrived to the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on July 9. That day everything was great. On July 10th, we rented pool bed pod on the lazy river. Again we were having a great time until a woman came up to our pod and stole our MGM Grand gold lion souvenir. At the time me and my husband were in the lazy river in front of our pod when the woman stole it and my husband walked up to her as she was trying to get into the lazy river to run off with it. He stopped her (no physical contact was made), told her that the souvenir did not belong to her and that he witnessed her stealing, drinking from it, and trying to get away. She confessed and my husband took the souvenir from her. I followed her around the lazy river because I want to make sure that security would kick her and her party out of the pool and hotel before she strike at another person's property. The security came and I identified to the them where the woman was, details on what she looked like and what she was wearing. The security guard saw the woman and told me that they would be on it. I walked back to my pod and I find my husband pissed off because not only did the woman try and steal the souvenir, my husbands wallet was missing $100 bill and our pod looked like like It was rummaged through. A total 4 security guards came to us to get more info. We explained again what had happen and the security guards told us again that they were on it and they will question the woman if they see her. My husband found her and her party back at their beach chairs getting ready to leave. My husband explained to the security guards were she was. They didn't care enough to see where or anything. My husband was very angry and irritated as we left the pool. Once we came back into the building my husband was was like 30ft In front of me and I notice a security guard yelling at my husband to put a mask on. I ran and told the security guard that we were sorry because I had his mask in my bag and we just came from a ordeal outside and forgot to put them on. He was rude and said I don't care he needs to have it on ( I've seen many people at the hotel not wearing a mask and nobody treated them in this manner). I told the security sorry again. This security guard just kept badgering and harassing my husband which cause to trigger his PTSD. My husbands body stiffen like a rock his fist clenched to his sides. I explained to the security guard they he has PTSD you harassing him is making matters worse. The security guard perceived that as aggression towards and said that my husband raise his fist at him which was a lie.He did not raise his hand to the security guard. At that point the security guard called for back up and yelled at me and my husband that we were we trespassing. The security guards back-up came and escorted us to a side door in the hotel to the outside. The formation of the security guards felt like they were trying to jump and beat us up. And yet the security guards were still harassing my husband, which was making the situation even worse. I can see my husband ready to explode. So I took the necessary action to defuse the highly volatile situation cause by the harassment of the security guards by shoving my husband to the floor before he actually explodes and hurts someone or himself. Once my husband was on the floor, I tried to kneel next to help Him understand where he was, who I was, and to apply DPS (deep pressure stimulation) which can help calm down the nervous system in people with PTSD. Then security grabbed me by my arms leaving me bruised. As I was trying to explain the the security guards again about my husbands PTSD, I seen one of the security guards arms go around my neck and his foot on my foot, he threw me Down on the floor. They handcuffed my husband and in the struggle his knees were bleeding ( they did not assist him with first aid). They let me up after they took my husband inside. I got up and notice my left had was hurting. I grab my stuff and they escorted me to a lunch room in the security building. I explained to the security guards that they need more training when it comes to dealing with PTSD. The supervisor security guard came to tell me that the police were on there way. When the police came they told me they were called for domestic violence. I was shocked. I explained to the police the situation. She went to look at the video tape of the incident. She then came back and told me they I was correct on what I did to diffuse the situation and no charges were to be filed. The supervisor security guard then told me we have been evicted and now considered trespassing on the property.

Unfortunately, they were booked to capacity and was denied. Okay, no biggie and my loss due to COVID regulations. So it goes.Firstly, the demographic of the MGM has just hit rock bottom. From what I've heard from locals I know, downtown has a cleaner group of guests. Again, nothing to really be bothered about; maybe the MGM did some marketing campaign to a specific income demographic or whatever, simply to increase their occupancy and I get it. No fault of theirs, just keeping rooms full.So, I get to my suite and the first thing I noticed is the blackout curtains are tattered and frayed at the ends due to the sunbeams coming through them. Yeah, a little upkeep would be nicer.Lay my bags open in the closet, go to the bathroom to shower, and I notice the wallpaper is peeling off the walls. I'm sure someone had to' have seen this and reported to \"engineering.\" I'll get to this later. I take a shower and the bathroom floods... More than likely because of the cracked shower base.After I finish mopping up my own bathroom, I call the front desk to tell them I can't do this and officially requesting a room change and don't care how much I have to pay. The concierge apologized and transferred me.\"Engineering...\" The phone responds.Evidently the policy of the MGM is to now have their guests submit their own work orders as their hotel falls apart. Okay, I'm over it... Two of my buddies arrive and I meet them in their rooms.The first thing one of them says is that he just turned down a room upgrade so we could all share the same floor. Wtf?!? Turned around, got on the phone again to tell them this is not tolerable. They immediately transferred me to engineering again to submit another work order. This is like a comedy movie at this point. I didn't know if I should just leave, complain more, or what. Unfortunately, there were four rooms checked and six people would have to change to other hotels on the same day. Not going to happen because of my bad luck. I accept my fate and vow to never stay at the MGM again.On my way over to the second buddy that checks in. His room had the cute security badge over the door/jam stating that the MGM cleans and sanitizes each and every room. That would be great if it was actually done because there was foundation and long hairs all over the bathroom.Gross!!!!I immediately got on the phone with American Express to tell them that they need to help me out since they were my booking agent. The rep was pleasant as can be and ended up apologetic as possible saying that the MGM was no assistance with them and that American Express was filing some type of formal complaint because of how inappropriate this was.Okay, I'm not even close to being done!!!On Saturday night, all my friends passed out, I decided to go gamble a little. As soon as I walk out of the elevator lobby and onto the casino floor, this older ratchety lady, probably mid 60s, walks up alongside me, with a 6'5\" God awful tall thug behind her. She politely asked if I'd like to party. I declined and walked on... Not the first time I'd been solicited by a streetwalker. She then pulled down her face mask, half her teeth were missing as she says \"I'll suck yo d***.\"Bursting into laughter, I declined again while the pimp pulled her by the arm to find another victim.As I made my way to the card tables, I noticed that the casino was a full-blown brothel!!! I'm not talking bunny ranch or 5 - 7 rating type stuff. I'm talking the darkest part of the alleys must have a direct connection to the casino at the MGM because it was full of real-life pimps and hos!!!!I can't even tell you how awkward it was seeing some 30-something guy playing the slots while a street walking prostitute is sitting in front of him spread eagle, all while a pimp is standing tall behind his property.This is not a fabrication in the slightest. If you want to walk down this reality, just walk through there at 5am on a Saturday morning! When I saw security walking around while all this was going on It was then that I realized this has to be blasted on the net. Apparently management must know about this because it just happens in broad and open view of security cameras and actually armed security!It's only a matter of time before they find woman dead in the casino with needles hanging out of their arms or gang violence kills someone.Whatever you do, if you value a clean room and no problems, and probably if you like security, spend an extra $50-100 and go to the Cosmo, Wynne, encore, I mean, heck... ANYWHERE!!!Also, I placed a complaint with the MGM, no response through their review service, and no response. American Express responded with apologies on their behalf though.Never going to an MGM show, venue, or hotel again.That's just my two cents.", "lang_code": "en", "author_avatar": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/mbdqCyog6aZcz8ReaH-KIg/60s.jpg", "author_url": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=GsH_hFCWrDSD4vmUmgjrzQ", "author_name": "Richard S.", "meta_data": {"author_contributions": 42, "feedback": {"useful": 8, "funny": 3, "cool": 0}}, "location": "Newport Beach, CA", "response": null}, {"review_url": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mgm-grand-hotel-las-vegas-5?hrid=jOgtez66HEES3whU3qHI3A", "id": "jOgtez66HEES3whU3qHI3A", "date": "2020-08-29", "rating": 5, "review_title": "", "review_text": "We had a rough start upon check-in.

Except, for Greg in security and his coworker decided to make it a poor experience. I will tell you about the good first.When I first came to Vegas about a couple of years ago, we were supposed to stay at MGM Grand. Lyft at the time (in fact, they never had it together until COVID) could not figure out the difference between MGM and the Mariott. So, the driver took us to MGM, but obviously she couldn't figure it out and thought that I was at fault. Lyft is messed up, trust me, I know since I drove for them.We ended up at Signature by mistake, which is on the other side of MGM Grand. Even though it was not MGM's error, they automatically switched us over to Signature. This was very cool and I loved Signature and have not really been back. This time, because of the pandemic, Park MGM closed. They were very helpful again and switched our room and comps over to MGM Grand. I totally forgot this was where I was going to be some time ago! Great! I got to stay at MGM Grand. So far, they have been taking very good care of us. Their hotels are elegant and they provide fantastic customer service.The security, however,is in desperate need of training. So, I realize that nobody really knows what to do during the pandemic. I get it and I cannot imagine working directly with the public right now and I am very thankful that I DO NOT work in public ANYMORE. Please note that I have been wearing a mask prior to people freaking out over toilet paper. I am pro-mask and I wear it any time I go out. I am cozy with a mask!So, I was sitting at a slot machine with a hot cup of coffee. My drink was sitting next to me and I would pick it up every so often to see if it cooled. I am actively trying to take a drink. Next thing, the security guy tapped on my shoulder, \"I'm afraid you will have to put your mask on.\" I guess I have to drink with a mask. My business partner tells me that I must be holding the drink. As I played on, the security guy was lingering nearby. I was thinking hopefully, he will be present when I am drinking because I know exactly what he is doing. He was only watching me and waiting to hassle me. So, I begin to drink again and this time I am holding me drink. He tapped on my shoulder again, \"I know you don't like wearing a mask, but I'm afraid you will have to wear it.\" So, now he is lecturing me of all people about the mask? Really? Really. I cooley ask for his name and he said \"Greg\" and he continued to go on his tangent about me being an anti-masker. I stopped him dead in his rhetoric, \"Greg, I have been watching you walk back and forth over here and you are harassing me.\" I am sure he was intimidated, who back talks security in Vegas? My business partner stifled a laugh and he joined, \"She was holding her drink.\" Greg starts to bail and continues to talk about masks being required and walks away from me. I told him, \"I'll be talking to your supervisor, Greg.\" Yep, I went in for the kill because this stopped him in his tracks and he comes back to repeat himself, but it was a lost cause. I scared him off, but his coworker was lingering now. We went to the other side of the casino. I see security, but not as often as Greg. Everyone is drinking their drink without a mask, playing holding their drink without a mask, and people have their mask under their nose and removing the mask to speak. In addition to this, Greg ignored social distancing guidelines. The slot machines are filthy with spills and ash and the last dirty hands that touched it. Why was I singled out by Greg? Due to the other resorts being closed at the last minute they were jam packed with people so again I was rubbing elbows with everyone and drunk people were getting in my space and other patrons were crowding into the elevator when there was a limit of 4 people!

I will never stay at this hotel again, ever.On July 17 my wife and I were celebrating our 26 year anniversary and decided to call it an early night and came back our suite to enjoy some takeout food and went to bed. Shortly before midnight, we were awoken by pounding on our door and the phone ringing in the room.  I answered the phone and was told that security was at the door and I needed to answer.  As I answered the door and to my surprise, there were 2 uniformed security guards, a security supervisor, and 4 Las Vegas Metro Police Officers waiting for me.  They told me to step outside where I was handcuffed, searched, and questioned while my wife was also pulled out of bed and questioned.A report of domestic abuse had come in and MGM security directed the responding officers to my room after \"verifying on CCTV\" that the suspect (me) had entered my room.  This is impossible because I had only left the room once to go get ice for dinner.After realizing that nothing was going on, the officers and security left just as quickly as they came, and at this point my wife was terrified.I called the security supervisor on duty who turned out to be extremely arrogant who offered nothing more than just a procedural explanation for what occurred.I then called the front desk and asked for the manager on duty who finally had offered some sort of apology for what had happened and assured me that either the security director would contact me, or one of the directors of the hotel.To this date, I have heard nothing from the hotel. I am by no means a whale where my money would make a difference to the resort, just a regular patron who was involved in an incident that could have been handled in a serious, sympathetic, and professional way. In a hotel that can tell what time it is on someone's watch with their camera system, I find it very likely that someone did not do their due diligence in investing where to send police.I write this poor review not because of the incident, but because of managements lack of taking ownership of what happened and offering a simple, \"we made a mistake, we are sorry\" by contacting me.I have made the decision to never stay at the property in the future, and for what it's worth sold my shares that I had in MGM resorts.", "lang_code": "en", "author_avatar": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/kTwh23-6f2ShMJ6IR2bWhw/60s.jpg", "author_url": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BckmeUUTvCJNwp9egKmyZQ", "author_name": "Anthony G.", "meta_data": {"author_contributions": 26, "feedback": {"useful": 1, "funny": 2, "cool": 0}}, "location": "San Bernardino, CA", "response": null}, {"review_url": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mgm-grand-hotel-las-vegas-5?hrid=pEqCFnhXEUouxAe6klfiDg", "id": "pEqCFnhXEUouxAe6klfiDg", "date": "2020-08-05", "rating": 1, "review_title": "", "review_text": "While we understand it's a pandemic and we are trying our best to adhere to the rules, I find it absolutely ridiculous that one of the pool attendants kept coming up and picking on us for the smallest of things (we were following the rules fyi).

Hand washing stations and hand sanitizer are available throughout the casino, and masks (required at all times) are located by the elevators.  All bars are closed except the ones that serve  food. Expect to pay $16 and up for a cocktail, and food must be ordered with drinks (even if it's a tray of dollar pretzels). Many visitors must have known about this because they came with their own beer. I carried around my Hydro Flask filled with alcohol, and it wasn't an issue. Cocktail waitresses still serve complimentary drinks while gambling. Because of physical distancing requirements, the number of people at the tables is extremely limited. It's especially hard to get a spot at roulette and poker in the evenings. Slot machines were fine and stillpaying out despite the hardships the casinos are facing. The district restaurants and shops close early, so plan accordingly. As a matter of fact, most shops on the strip closed by 7pm. I cannot stress this enough: book your chair/daybed/cabana the moment you book your room. The pool is operating at limited capacity, and many guests were angry because it was full and they couldn't get in. Believe me, you want a spot by that lazy river. It was quiet and so relaxing! Our server was outstanding, the food was delish, and the cucumber cooler was so refreshing. It cost a fortune, but we expected that. I brought in a small MGM bag with some beers, and it wasn't an issue. Masks must be worn at all times unless you're in the pool or ACTIVELY eating/drinking. We saw some anti-maskers rightfully get kicked out after a couple of warnings. I even got told to put it on in between sips. The double beds in the west wing were so uncomfortable, but the room was nice and clean. I brought my Lysol and sprayed everything for extra precaution. A complimentary bag with masks, sanitizer, and two styluses will be waiting for No valet available, but there is complimentary parking in the structure. It's a long hike, so pack lightly. Do bring a gallon of water and sunblock with you because it's expensive to buy here. We had a fantastic time, and I never felt like my health was in jeopardy.

We visit Las Vegas and stay at MGM approximately three times per year, always in the Marquise Suite. We are Mlife platinum cardholders, and have the credit card as well. Unfortunately, after our most recent stay, we have decided to take our business elsewhere.  We are returning home today after a four night stay at MGM, which was unlike any other.  Although the experience at the pool was a joke, and many of our favorite restaurants were closed....it was to be expected due to the Covid pandemic and wasn't a serious cause of concern. The issues which cannot be overlooked are two-fold:First, our suite wreaked of sewer water. The smell would come and go throughout the day. We did request our suite be serviced and were advised that it is the water in Las Vegas and nothing could be done about it. As previously mentioned, we always stay in this suite and never previously experienced  the issue. Further, if MGM is aware of the stinky problem they should do something to mitigate the issue (i.e. air filtration system, air deodorizing system, etc...). Under no circumstance should patrons pay the hefty price of a suite and  have to endure  a stink like that. Disgusting!!Secondly and more importantly, was the change in clientele at MGM.  The patrons were unlike anything I previously experienced. It was terrifying. I have never been afraid to be on the casino floor, however this past weekend was a different story.  Many patrons were relatively young, loud, aggressive and confrontational. Although I have come to expect there will always be a bad element in the evenings, as some can't handle the booze they have consumed, I never expected to feel unsafe throughout the day. Although there were a good number of security within the casino, I didn't feel they did anything to control inappropriate behavior that permeated the entire casino. It began the minute you exited the elevator as tempers flared due to the social distancing efforts of security. A simple stroll through the casino became a very difficult task, as I had to take alternate routes to avoid congregated groups of younger visitors that were yelling, cussing, pushing each other around, smoking marijuana...I can go on and on.  The security and staff were quick to enforce mask guidelines, but did nothing to enforce the inappropriate conduct of many of their guests. There were people smoking marijuana on the casino floor as they played slots and stood in the common walkways.  Prostitution was brazen in the evenings....I watched and heard prostitutes approach men and openly proposition. (*This occurred near the lobby, where there were always several  security officers on standby.)  I repeatedly questioned why the officers did nothing and have come to the conclusion that MGM is willing to put up with this conduct in an effort to keep business coming through their doors.Although a loyal MGM visitor, I think it is time my family and I take our business to another property.

A lot of hotels are offering no resort fees for locals so we are taking the opportunity to stay at the wonderful hotels vegas has to offers during this time. This hotel has gone downhill in my opinion. Everything is extremely far to get to, from the pool to your room to parking, to even get out to walk on the strip. They are dog friendlyOur hotel room was a suite and at first glance everything seemed nice and well put together. In reality the couch was old, had stains and sunk in from everyone sitting on it for years, the mattress was sunk in the middle and needed to be tossed out, just little things here and there that were broken, there were remnants of a party previously to us being in the room, trash on the ground and a few stains on the sheets. We didn't realize there were different pools for different ages and we took our 2 year old to the furthest one from the entrance, I have now come to realize after reading the sign when we got out that it was the adult pool because OMG!  when we first got there it was couples all on each other in the pool, out the pool I called it the sex pool. They were all 1 shot away of having just one big orgy  the next day we went to the first pool which was the family pool and it was better. The waitress was amazing and very tentative. I didn't catch her name but she was the skinny black lady. I ordered a slushie drink and a blue moon which was around $30. There are plenty of places to eat in this hotel so you won't go hungry or have to venture off the property. The room service is VERY expensive so steer clear! It was like 20 bucks for a muffin and grapes. If it was alcohol it would be ok but not for a muffin and a grape. In conclusion it was just ok.

Here are some details.Check in was by far the easiest I have ever experienced in my entire life at any hotel. Download the app and it's even easier. There is no valet, only self parking. We drove up to front, unloaded our bags and husband went to park truck. They do have Bell desk still available. We checked our bags and proceeded inside to get some physical cards for our room. I received our room number 2 hours before our arrival which was at 1pm. I didn't pay for early check-in, I just noted it was expected time of arrival.There are a couple people to help at check-in, but it's mostly Contactless. I used my barcode on my phone to get extra keys by scanning my room number on to tablet and inserting keys on my own. You can get up to 4 keys.We were physically in our room within 15minutes of our arrival. A super plus in my book. Especially when you have 3 kids with you.The room... it's clean and they will in fact still come to service it everyday. I did my own little Lysol spray down but feel if I wasn't able to, we still would have had a clean room. They put a little tape at the door seal that states the room has been sanitized as well as on the remote and other highly touched surfaces in the room.A little about the casino and masks. They have masks and hand sanitizer throughout the casino. Wearing them is being enforced while walking around. It's not just enforced by security but most hotel employees also. They provide you with a nice little welcome kit in your room that includes hand sanitizer, 2 MGM masks, and the touch less keys you see all over TV.They do have the social distancing circles on the floor at some spots like entrance to elevator, stores and high traffic areas, but it's not super enforced because it wasn't very busy.Playing tables have the plexiglass partitions and machines are every other open. You are still allowed to smoke and drink but have to be actively doing it to have your mask off. All shows are cancelled still and the food court had 3 places open. Johnny rockets, pizza place and Asian cuisine. To eat at a restaurant you need to have reservations, no walk-ins.On to the pool. It is open and the lazy river is open as well. On our arrival, we were able to get down to the pool around 2:30pm and still find a spot. Lounge chairs are at half availability and we were informed that when I called. But we were able to get in both days no problem without renting anything which we thought we might have to. Pool process.... they will let people in until it reached the given capacity. At that time they will start a waitlist and call you when you can come in. If you want to guarantee a spot with all day access,they recommend you reserve a chair, pod or cabana. We didn't need to do that and based on the price of them, were very happy we didn't. Same rules apply for the masks in pool. You do not have to wear mask in pool or walking to and from it. But it is enforced at your lounge chair which makes you sweat even more. That part was not fun. And I'm assuming that they are understaffed because the first day it took forever to get a drink and they don't allow you to walk up to purchase your own. Day 2 we brought our own snacks and drinks for the kids because waiting for them would not have been feasible. Our cocktail waitress was hustling getting drinks out to everyone, so kudos to you Alina! We appreciated you keeping mom and dad hydrated. Over all the stay was great. 2 negatives and the reason for 4 stars. The toilet in the bathroom of our room was super annoying. The tank kept refilling every couple minutes and it was loud enough to be heard from the room. I even took the top of the tank off to try to fix it myself and no luck.2nd would be for the mean security at the pool. Fiddling with masks at the pool is hard and something you need to get used to... tack on kids into the equation and geez! Anyhow, he happened to be walking by as I had just put down my drink to cover my child next to me who was cold. This security yells from across the lazy river \" Mrs.! Put your mask on! This is your first warning!\" Was really rude and uncalled for. My son looked at me and asked \" mom why is he mad at you.\" I wish I would have got his name but I didn't want that incident to take over my time with my family. From someone who works at a hospital and wears a mask for 12 hours straight days in a row, I'm the last person that needs to be lectured. MGM should really educate their employees on how to NOT  let the recent situation in this world take away from simple human decency and treating people with kindness still. People like myself and my family giving places like this a chance are part of the reason they still have a job right now.

You don't have to wear a mask when you're outside around hundreds of people at the pool. when you're walking around inside the casino no one is social distancing. But they randomly enforce social distancing for in room dining. I couldn't even order a pitcher of water due to the social distancing rules. Blew my mind. On top of that they serve everything on TON of plastic plates but serve food in real plates at the casino restaurants. So much for classy taste. I must've gotten 20 plastic containers for my in room dining. What a waste. And horrible for the environment.

He literally couldn't have cared less. I'm beyond disgusted by the customer service provided. On top of that, there is a man named Danny So who is a manager on the floor of the casino...he really topped it off. I was gambling with my husband at the table. Betting on roulette. It was me, another man and my husband. He came over and told me to stay 6 feet back if I'm not gambling. I explained I was and he walked away. Two more men came and sat down. Now there are 5 men and my husband playing. Me standing next to my husband, still playing roulette. He came up again, told ME to stand back as only 6 people are allowed to play. He didn't ask one of the men to leave. He asked me. Even though I had been sitting there and playing for quite some time before the other men came to play. Both my husband and I were shocked, we got up and left. To top it off. As we were checking out. The line to check in and out took over an hour to get through. They had three individuals working. Sunday morning. July 5th. After a holiday weekend. Three people checking out guests. I understand needing to social distance. But at what point does having a line of 75+ people in the middle of your lobby cross the line of unacceptable. Isn't that worse than having people standing 6 feet apart all checking out at the same time? I will never ever be staying here again. Not worth the money. Not worth the headache. Not worth feeling dirty in your own hotel room. Not worth being mistreated by a misogynistic asshole. Stay ANYWHERE else.

We were asked to form lines in order to maintain social distancing within the elevators, yet they remained packed full once you step in. At first arrivals only about 70% of people were wearing masks. Within a couple days, the hotel enforced a rule mandating that masks are required upon all movement within the hotel. This was very reassuring and made us feel a lot more comfortable. They had hand washing stations spread out through the casinos and hand sanitizing  stations absolutely everywhere. They even provided unlimited masks next to all sanitizing stations. The temperature inside the hotel was very cold, but considering how hot it was outside, it probably helped more than hurt. Maybe, keep it a little warmer though, because going in and out between the two temperatures is a good sure way of going home with a cold. We were not too pleased with the organizing and prioritization of the bell desk when checking our luggage on the way out, but it was nothing compared to the overall decent experience we had.

Lazy River is only running on weekends and the hot tubs are closed until further notice. However, we are still paying 100% in resort fees. Third, as to be expected, a lot is closed in terms of restaurants and shops. There are a lot of people here and have all been bottle necked into specific areas in spite of social distancing.

It was my first time going to the MGM Grand, Monday June 22nd 2020.. I just celebrated my birthday and decided to go to Vegas. When I check in everything seemed fine Until I went downstairs to play the slot machines at the casino. I noticed a security guard by the name of \"Hacob\" Walking around me for hours. Then when I finished playing the slot machine I mingle around with my friend, started talking to people inside the casino because they were friendly. Noticed that \"Hacob\" kept staring at me and walking near me. He then out of nowhere asked for my ID, mind you I've been at the hotel for hours and I've seen him walk past me for hours and also I just checked in the hotel not even three hours ago. I asked him why he didn't have a valid reason, then just vaguely said it's for age verification just so he can have a reason to look at my ID. I asked for a supervisor, and when his supervisor came I asked her why does he Need to see my ID. She stated that they do check random IDs for age verification. I stated that he's been walking around me for hours, if he thought I was under age he should of been asked me for my ID. Mind you he did not ask anyone else around me even people that looked younger than me for identification he only asked me. I then got frustrated and asked to go to the front desk because I felt I was being discriminated against by being the only black person in that area also I thought it was something deeper than just age verification because HACOB made it very vaguely on why he wanted to check my ID. I don't know if his assumption was that I didn't have a room there or I was a prostitute but for him to ask for my ID out of nowhere And he's been walking around me for hours, I felt that was a problem. We then go to the front desk where manager \"Steve\" was there. I explain to him everything that happened and he told me blatantly that there is nothing he can do about that. Mind you I have everything on video. I then asked him to ask the supervisor what is the security guards name because I want to file a complaint he told me that he will be able to get that for me so he leaves and go to the back. He comes out with a change of heart stating that he wants to make things right because he spoke to the supervisor, a white woman, about what happened and wanted to grant me $75 in food and beverage money. I was so upset because when I explained to \"Steve \" He did not believe me. Only when a white woman told him what happened he then try to accommodate me. I told him I felt he was not trying to make me feel better he just wanted me to leave the front desk. I was so embarrassed/hurt because I was not taken seriously until a white woman spoke for me which is not OK. \"Steve \"did not care about accommodating me in order for me to feel comfortable staying there after I told him what happened.

He didn't want to tell me his last name because I told him I was going to call corporate and File a report against him and the security guards at the MGM Grand. \"Steve \" then told me that if I didn't want the $75 credit I need to leave the front desk because I am disturbing the peace. \"Steve\" should be fired because no manager should act that way towards hotel guest!", "lang_code": "en", "author_avatar": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "author_url": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0mLAl1zSH7AV951pat4ugw", "author_name": "Keijanna S.", "meta_data": {"author_contributions": 3, "feedback": {"useful": 0, "funny": 2, "cool": 0}}, "location": "Los Angeles, CA", "response": null}, {"review_url": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mgm-grand-hotel-las-vegas-5?hrid=dPcRu1eJph6OOsrvHMTMYA", "id": "dPcRu1eJph6OOsrvHMTMYA", "date": "2020-06-25", "rating": 1, "review_title": "", "review_text": "Literally the worst experience I've had at a hotel we get a room had just got done from driving from Temecula and visiting family just wanted to get a room and go to sleep we get in the room and immediately we noticed a screeching noise coming from the toilet we dealt with it I figured we could just close the door and you would hear it less, then we went to go take a shower and the water was boiling hot we cannot fix the temperature no matter what we attempted do the water would stay boiling hot then we went to go and brush our teeth and the water had completely turned off we had no running water.

Her response \"Well it is not fun for us either, it is really busy today\" and she walked away. That is ridiculous!As others have mentioned their was no social distancing, they closed the lazy rivier after I called days before to make sure it was open. (They changed to only be open on weekends) The 3 pools were not open. Only one main pool packed with people all on top of each other. Mind you we paid a $40 per day resort fee, for only one pool to be open and packed with people. Such a waste. I only sat staff cleaning the escalator to the parking lot twice on out 5 day trip and one cleaning the water feature near the elevators.

I often smelled marijuana in the casino floor and in the hallway walking to our room.I knew going in they would not clean your room during your stay, i did read the 7 page |safety plan\" however they did not follow thought with cleaning and social distancing.

Prior to this, I\"d stayed here a number of times but never had so many issues.  I don't know why things were so terrible this time around. Social distancing was challenging.  There were wash stations throughout and hand sanitizing stations but it was pretty often that I saw kids taking gloves by the handful and masks by the box as well. There should be someone at those supply stations to kind of regulate the number of items that you are able to take from their dispensers at a time. Also, people are getting into fights where the elevators are.  People cut into lines and of course that makes ppl go nuts. People in the elevators do and don't wear masks. The ones that don't should be in their elevator car on their own. I understand that it can be a pain to wait for the next one but it might be for your safety. Ugh!! I was very disappointed during my last visit. There were housekeeping floor managers snapping at their house keeping team members. There were bits of something in my bathroom sink basin.  I'd looked in the mini bar fridge in my room to see how it'd been stocked. I noticed there were several items missing and that there were some things in the fridge that had been moved and were off of their sensors. I immediately went to the front desk to bring that issue to their attention. They said that my room had some charges on it already but that they would remove them and that they'd send someone from the mini bar team to check it out and to remove the item that was off of the sensor. That NEVER happened. I also had an issue with the mini fridge that I'd requested for use to store medication. I turned the level of coldness down to a 2-3 but it still froze my husband's medications. The ice machine on our floor wasn't working although I'd checked all throughout the 2 full days that we were guests at the hotel. We'd not put up a do not disturb sign on our door but still our room wasn't ever refreshed. I mentioned this to the desk when I checked out and they said that because I was a gold M Life card holder that they should have told me that I'd need to request for housekeeping to come in. I don't think that should have had anything to do with my status in M Life card. It should have been something that all guests should have been told upon arrival.  I'd also wondered why a seal wasn't ever put onto my room prior to my arrival to give us some sort of reassurance that our room had been thoroughly cleaned. The answer I got felt like BS. The person I'd asked about this was another house keeping team member. They said that it was sort of a luck of the draw sort of thing, some rooms got those seals and some didn't. I did NOT at all feel confident that MGM took my health and safety as a priority.  I understand that this whole situation with all these new practices are NEW. . . but if the hotel has so many discrepancies and has so much trouble with these new ordinances, maybe they weren't really ready to open?!?! Anyway. . . Robell was the one MGM staff member who was super helpful to me. He was on top of things and did his best to try and resolve a few of my issues that I'd had during my stay.  uggghhhhhh. And then there is the parking lot. Portions of it are blocked off and it makes it a million times more difficult to exit the lot but also to access vacant and convenient as possible parking spots.

And also King rooms for the Grand part of the hotel; which we are staying in. I went down and spoke to the manager (Darrin) about this issue. I then told him that the men staying in the rooms are 6' and that it would be comfortable for them to have a king bed and for me a walk-in shower since my knee is not working correctly. He checked his system to see if their are any rooms available tomorrow with a walk-in shower. He said to call the front desk at 1pm. Besides the walk-in shower. We won't know what the room is going. Update: We got king size beds. Our room does have a walk-in shower but the other room still has a tub. The queen beds were harder then the king bed. The walls are very thin. We could hear music and people talking. I would not recommend MGM Hotel Casino.

I called the reservation line.  Expecting a version of \"Thank you for calling the MGM grand reservation line, my name is _________, how may I assist you?\" - instead I was greeted with a monotone \"Hello?\"   So the awkward opening of this exchange went:MGM - Hello?Me - Hello?MGM - Yes?Me - is this the reservation line?MGM - Yeah, can I help you?I then explained that I was coming to Vegas in June for work/play and I was offered a room at another hotel on the strip, but I've always enjoyed the MGM properties so I was hoping to possibly book a room here if the prices were comparable.  The response was a very long, but quick, (and again monotone) sentence along the lines of:MGM:  \"Okay we have our King suite in the tower, that includes a full king bed, at out special rate for our Mlife Gold members is $47.99, after taxes and fees it'll be $207.44, your deposit today will be $53 you can put that on your card, can you please give me the first four digits of the credit card you plan to use?\"Okay, there's a lot to unpack there.  I then explained that on the MGM website the rooms were listed at $39 a night, is that information correct?  Is it cheaper if I just book online?  To which I got an annoyed response along the lines of:MGM:  \"Those are the cheaper rooms in the other tower.\"(Side note:  I'm referring to them as \"MGM\" because the person STILL hasn't introduced themselves and given me any kind of name)MGM cont: \"If you'd like to book those the final cost will be $197.15 for both nights, can I get your card number for the deposit?\"So I then tried to continue to clarifyMe - So it's basically $100 a night to stay at MGM.MGM - no sir, as I explained the rooms are $39Me - But you said the final cost was $197 correct?MGM - yes....Me - so 197... divided by 2 nights... means the cost is $98.50 a night.MGM - No the ROOM is $39... the resort fees are what take it up to $197.Me - I understand that, so the bottom line is the best rate that you have is $98.50 a night.MGM - No... the best rate I have is $39 as I mentioned before...Me - Okay... how much would I have to pay, in total, to sleep in a room at MGM for one night?MGM - .....Now I know I got a little snarky at the end there, but it was frustrating to have Mr/Mrs \"I don't know his/her name because they didn't bother introducing themselves\" condescend to me about basic math, especially since they obviously knew the point I was making.  I have another review on here from last year when I stayed at Aria and got destroyed at a high limit black jack table in 10 minutes (on some really bad beats)... where the dealer, AND pit boss, both laughed and condescended to me without any empathy or kindness.  I understand those are the risks of gambling, but to have the employees not even ATTEMPT to soften that bad beat in any way (chat, joke, a \"that sucks, I'm sorry\") seems to be a common thread in the MGM properties now... Employees talking down to the customers that are spending money... or ATTEMPTING to spend money, in this reservations case.Anyway, I digress.  I asked the reservation line if there were any rates in the $120-$150 range TOTAL.  I was told I would have to reserve the room at full price then talk to the front desk when I get here about any discounts... So I'd have to chance it... and as I've learned lately... Gambling at MGM properties isn't a very pleasant experience.  So I decided to stay at another hotel on the strip, and I'll probably be allowing my Gold status at MGM to lapse and build my tiers at a new place.  One that may show a higher level of BASIC customer service.  I used my Mlife credit card to pay for the room...

So, they sat on the FLOOR. Within 5 mins a security guard comes over and tells me kids CANNOT sit on the floor and must stand. Hello, what are they to sit on?

So thoughtful of them. #2- Main pool was closed and the closest heated pool was, and I am not kidding was a mile away. You could see the MGM building from the pool it was that far. Nice considering the ridiculous mandatory resort fee includes the use of ALL pools. Also pool closed at 4pm! #3- No microwave and fridge is stocked w hotel food and drinks and if you empty it out to put your stuff in there, you WILL be charged. #4- Extremely dated hotel room and we were on a non-smoking floor but room smelled dimly of cigarette smoke. It wasn't strong but if you hv a sensitive nose it will bother you. #5- MGM is not centrally located and old. If you're a childless adult and like a modern, sexy, centrally located hotel, try Aria or Cosmopolitan. Aria is particularly gorgeous. #6- There was a fight exhibition going on and the lobby area would be packed!! If you like large crowds by all means stay there. The one thing I did like was the shower had great water pressure. And that was pretty much it.

We called the front desk thinking maybe we weren't given a non-smoking room. We were told all rooms were non-smoking. The front desk said they were fully booked and would send someone with air freshener. When the employee came in our room he immediately stepped back and said \"Wow, air freshener isn't going to help here.\" He attempted to get us a new room but was told to use there machine to clean carpets. We went to the front desk and asked for a new room. They obliged which we were pleased with, no biggie. When arriving to the new room we entered to a dirty room that was not cleaned from the previous guest. We called the front desk again where she apologized, stated there were no other rooms available, and she would credit our room 2 buffet meals and when we returned the room would be ready. We had Mastros dinner reservations and didn't want to eat a big meal for lunch but decided to just go check out something light to eat with some wine at the Buffet. I'm very easy going so at this point I was okay with MGMs mistake and attempt to make things right. After the buffet and some gambling we returned to our room almost 4 hours later. The room was still dirty. I called the desk apologizing for my frustrations but this is the third time upon arrival  that I am calling about issues with our room. She apologized again. We were unable to take showers and get ready for our Mastros reservation because we didn't want to use a dirty bathroom that was not cleaned from previous guests. We threw ourselves together for dinner. Upon leaving for dinner reservations the housekeeping staff had finally arrived. I was so displeased and am not sure how there can be that much lack of communication among staff. I know I used a free night but I spent a lot of money to obtain that free night award and wish I would have used it at a different hotel.

I believe I made a mistake online when I was offered 2 nights comped and unfortunately only booked 1 night. The front desk clerk told me I only had 1 night, and I corrected him, telling him I had 2. He stated I only had one night booked and the second night would be about $94 (not to mention those nasty resort/parking fees this company started on the Strip,) but I should be able to talk with the Mlife Players Booth to attempt to get back second offered night.20 minutes later, I spoke with the Mlife employee and she had to call her manager. I stood there while she had a personal conversation with the person on the other end and was laughing and laughing. When she finished, she put on a different face and told me it was absolutely impossible to comp me a 2nd night despite the offer. I asked if she was for sure since this is the absolute worst way to woo a new customer to a casino. She was definite. She told me it was based on availability and I would have to pay $94 (plus those crummy resort and parking fees.)Just so you know, they have 7,000 rooms - I believe the 3rd largest in the world? and the place as I observed that weekend, was more than half dead. There were no lines to the lousy buffet, no wait on any machine or table, the bars had many seats available. Additionally, I come to Las Vegas 4-6 times a year and bring available cash to gamble as entertainment. Believe me, any casino wants a gambler like myself in their place.I decided right then and there, I would never, ever give MGM another dime of my gambling money. I've heard so many horror stories about their business practices in the past such as the aforementioned terrible trend of resort/parking fees and the ways they treat and lay off their staff and for years, despite my established Vegas spending habits, they've never given me comps, so I've all-but ignored them. Suddenly, out of the blue, they start sending me offers. So, I took them up for the previously mentioned 2-night stay at MGM Resort. Yes, I did make the error online inadvertently only selecting one night. This is the easiest mistake to correct and profitable for the casino with the money I bring throughout the year. This is a way to keep a customer for life and spread good word-of-mouth for a company known for nickel/diming and pissing off their patrons. And whenever I've had a bad experience at Caesars, they immediately go out of their way to fix it and make me happy. Sadly, I thanked them for going to their competitors. I'm sorry I did that, Caesars and please know, thanks to MGM employees, I will be back to you with all my money.As for the rest of the place/experience, the room was alright. Nothing at all special and had blood (rust?) stains in the bathroom. The bed was okay, but I've had so much better in Vegas and the Eastern view they gave me was thee most bland and boring I've ever seen and I do love me some great views when I stay in Vegas. Caesars always makes sure I have a beautiful view of the Strip WITHOUT CHARGING ME.I've had their buffet once, maybe 14 years ago. I thought it was so incredibly bland and boring, I've never returned until now. I was going to use that $50 resort credit at the Aria for a real buffet, but of course, at MGM, they stated I could only use the free $50 at the place I was staying at (this is NOT the case at Caesars.) So, I was forced to try the Strip's worst buffet again. The food selection was small, it mostly soggy and barely edible. I think I did like random Pizza/Pepperoni taquitos, but that's hardly worth the incredibly low $18.99 price tag that morning. And speaking of which, that should be a huge red flag, if the NO LINE AT ALL wasn't enough. If you're paying under $30 for a buffet in Vegas, it should be considered to be of the same quality as the buffet in the movie Vegas Vacation. Final words on that buffet: you have to get your own drinks and no straws, unless specifically requested. So, I did and I've heard of that awful change to paper straws which was based on a viral myth but up to this point, I've never had one. Now I know why people hate them. They're awful!! They taste terrible making whatever drink I have unbearable. So, I have the choice of putting my mouth on a glass millions of people have or the terrible taste of paper straws. Thanks, MGM.MGM, you had two huge opportunities to resolve my error and you failed both times. I kept to my word and didn't give your resorts another dime of my gambling money. I went across the street to the new OYO and Tropicana. They both had incredible and fun staffs and I made sure they all knew how I was treated across the street.I hope you read this MGM Grand and take this to heart for other new customers to your establishment.", "lang_code": "en", "author_avatar": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/4apUZ5PdtqALotQYWBog5w/60s.jpg", "author_url": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CLLO-buEMEL0iGEt-uqvHQ", "author_name": "Steve R.", "meta_data": {"author_contributions": 43, "feedback": {"useful": 4, "funny": 3, "cool": 0}}, "location": "Glendale, AZ", "response": null}, {"review_url": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mgm-grand-hotel-las-vegas-5?hrid=5RDbLkdEQ4zMNXBqN5GSOA", "id": "5RDbLkdEQ4zMNXBqN5GSOA", "date": "2020-01-20", "rating": 2, "review_title": "", "review_text": "The Bad: We didn't have a good experience at this hotel.

We have been to Vegas many times, but this was our first time staying at the MGM grand. We specifically picked it after reading good reviews. Unfortunately our experience has been less than ideal. In fact, the only positive thing I can think to say, is that the view from our room on the 18th floor of the grand tower is nice. We opted to use the valet service which was an additional $35 a day. Once we were in our room we discovered that the mini fridge is stocked with items that are weighted so that nothing can be removed or added without being charged. Two members of my family are diabetic and refrigerate their insulin. When we called the front desk we were told if the insulin was placed in the fridge we would be charged $50. They opted not to refrigerate it. As our luggage was being delivered to the room, we struck up a conversation with the bellman. When we asked about activities for kids, he informed us there wasn't much for kids our age to do. (They are 6, 9 and 10.) This was quite upsetting to us, as many reviews we read mentioned the family friendly nature of the hotel.Our room did not have a coffee pot, which we found unusual, but perhaps that is common in some strip hotels.The internet did not work well at all for us.On night two, which was a Saturday, our room began smelling overwhelmingly of marijuana. I'm not just talking about a slight smell, it was very strong. Eventually we called the front desk and they sent someone with some type of machine that sprayed cleaner on the carpet. For a short period, we had that smell to deal with and then the pot took over again. We smelled pot off and on our entire stay. We made multiple calls to the front desk and though they acknowledged it and sent then carpet machine. The smell never stopped. I see in their policies that they collect a hefty fee for anyone who smokes in their supposedly smoke free hotel. However, we were never offered any sort of discount of our resort fees or even a chance to change rooms. Also, I believe the room above us was a nicer room with a balcony of some type, as we heard noises of people walking around, moving furniture and playing loud music until very late one night.We also learned that there was no room service offered. Apparently they cook your food, package it in to go boxes and drop it off. In my opinion, not having room service at a hotel of the MGM's caliber makes no sense at all. I'm actually not even sure if the take out food service is available in all rooms. My family had two rooms. One room had a menu, while our other room had no menu or food option on the tv menu. We were both in the same hallway, just at opposite ends.At midnight, we attempted to find late night food. We were turned away from 3 of the food court restaurants by staff telling us they were closed and finally went for pizza, which I believe is the only hot food option after midnight inside the MGM.Unless there is another pool area that I'm not aware of, the pool was very small. Yes, the lazy river was closed for the season, but the only open pool was very small. I saw other pools, but I believe that even when they are open, they are adult only or private pools I can only imagine how crowded it must get in warmer weather.We check out tomorrow and perhaps I will have an update to this review. At the moment, I would say that we've truly been made to feel how insignificant our families experience is. For us two rooms for three nights plus everything else really adds up. I know it's nothing to the MGM and they could care less if our family comes here again, but maybe one family will read this and reconsider staying here. I can tell you, we will never stay here again and we will tell everyone we know about our experience.", "lang_code": "en", "author_avatar": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/wih27EreZcj7jUh2mtpIdw/60s.jpg", "author_url": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_CzeiN7PfbgoVHUxbUt8SQ", "author_name": "Mary Beth P.", "meta_data": {"author_contributions": 5, "feedback": {"useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}}, "location": "Oklahoma City, OK", "response": null}, {"review_url": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mgm-grand-hotel-las-vegas-5?hrid=gUcgSY7rTlquZ95iKowY3g", "id": "gUcgSY7rTlquZ95iKowY3g", "date": "2020-01-19", "rating": 1, "review_title": "", "review_text": "Worst experience,  will never comeback here.

I read some reviews before we went that terrified me, but we had a good stay.  Contrary to what some people experienced, we had plenty of hot water with excellent pressure and I really enjoyed the shower.  The room was nice enough, though a touch shabby in some details like chipped paint, worn chair, tired sink grout, carpet, etc. The clock radio CD player (cd player!? Lol) didn't work.  I guess that kind of gives you an idea about the age of the hotel. We both slept well and I liked the linens and comforter.  I also liked the layout and the closet.  The frosted glass doors of the shower and toilet area were not a problem, except that our handles were a little loose so they were a tad noisy at times. I really liked the location of the west wing and that if you take the west wing elevators down, you are very close to doors that exit almost right onto the strip. It was incredibly convenient to have that entry/exit so close.  Also, I called the front desk a handful of times, and there was always someone answering right away.Our view was even good, looking out over The Mansion next-door, and with some side views of the strip. I absolutely cannot complain.  Also, our room was cleaned very well, and the staff was pleasant.Also, one of the best things about this hotel is that the pool was open during our January stay. The water was a warm 80/85\u00b0, and we were by ourselves swimming most of the time. They had to have lifeguards there to watch us just to obey the rules, but it was very relaxing. The Jacuzzi was also open, and was great!  The whole pool area is absolutely stunning. You need to wear clothes from your room to get there, because you were walking quite a distance through the entire hotel, but there are bathrooms there where you can change. From other people I talk to, their hotel pools were not open at this time. To me, this was a real plus of staying at the MGM Grand.The rest of the hotel and the casino itself were beautiful. There are plenty of high-end places to eat and things to see. The food court offerings had a variety, but they were expensive! There is a conveniently located ABC store just up the strip, which has a lot of affordable stuff. Likewise, there is a CVS also just up the strip on the other side.We decided to see the show KA\u0301 there during our stay. We got tickets from the box office the day of the show, a Tuesday. The person selling us the tickets made it sound like we were so lucky to get these great seats and that usually they were gone. Granted, they were in the center section, and not the sides, but at the time of the show, the theater still had tons of seats that were empty. As I understand it, the show has been playing there for well over 10 years. It has some amazing features that are specific to that auditorium, so it will never go on the road. I think it is worth seeing, but I would make sure you get a deal on your tickets on a weekday. I think ours were $79 plus the booking fees. We were in FF in the center section. Would I stay again?

We get ready to grab some breakfast and walk around for the entire afternoon.  At 2pm we head back to the MGM and enter the elevator with a bunch of other patrons. About 25 floors up we realize there's something awry since we cannot access our floor with our room key.

Loads of slot machines and plenty of table games are available for patrons. Check-in at the MLife counter to pick up a card to use and accumulate points for gaming and dining. These can be redeemed later for some nice benefits. The biggest drawback to the gaming floor is the amount of ever-present smoke. I sooo wish there was a larger non-smoking section and better ventilation in general. As a non-smoker, I didn't like inhaling so much 2nd hand smoke while playing or my clothes smelling like smoke when I left the floor. I realize that's a part of playing casino games but this gaming floor was much smokier than some of the others I visited on this trip. The hotel room was just average. Although I stayed in a more recently renovated room, it was pretty standard. There was a free safe in the room but there was a $35 fee to use the mini fridge.

Their west wing is a depressing dungeon with unclean and broken room fixtures. (See pictures) My group and I immediately went back to concierge,  this time to a different representative and after showing pictures and expressing how unfit our rooms were, we were immediately upgraded complimentary to their grand suites. What was even better was the fact that we were all on the same floor just a few doors down from each other. Before we were all on different floors without access to each other's floors and it was a hot mess. Im not sure why one representative told us that the rest of the rooms were booked,  but then a few minutes later a different representative was able accommodate us....But after the whole room ordeal we had a great time.As a business owner I'd be ashamed to offer these rooms to guests.

My brother in law flew to Vegas with a woman he had known for 8 days, with the intention of marrying her. She paid for everything. He was in an electric wheelchair because he had just had surgery to repair his leg that was broken in 6 places. Three days in, there was a fight, and he was abandoned in a paid hotel room at the MGM Grand. He only had his ID, no credit card, and not a cent to his name. He is a moron. He had the room for one more night until his flight home. Why am I giving this review? Because the lucky lady bailed on my brother in law, which was probably the best choice she could make. He called for help to my wife and I in Seattle, and we called the MGM Grand, attempting to put our credit card to use to keep him in the room, that was already paid for. The problem was that they have to have an active credit card on file for the room, even if it is paid for, in order to charge the daily resort fees. Attempting to just pay it took hours, on Xmas Eve. We had to get some sort of credit card form emailed to us, and faxed back to them, and eventually after numerous phone calls we think everything is good. We think my idiot brother in law is back in his room and we can actually have Xmas Eve dinner. We then get a call that he was locked out of his room anyways. His room, that was already paid for one more night with our new credit card on file and charged for $41 in resort fees, with an additional $15 to pay this way. He didn't have his phone charge cord initially, so he used the in-room phone to call Seattle to beg for my wife's help. This cost $27 per call. It counts as part of an incidental for costs applied to the room, but they will NOT apply that to the credit card we spent hours, a half dozen phone calls, and an extra fee to set up. There is around $100 in charges. We ask how we can pay that from Seattle, and the staff were not very nice. They said he had to pay cash. We pointed out he had none, and we had been on the phone with them all morning setting up the new card. They said he could walk to somewhere to get money. We pointed out my idiot brother in law was the man sitting on the electric wheelchair charging it in the lobby because he was stuck with a broken leg. He had no phone charger and was unable to coordinate otherwise. We were not given any options, and the staff just kept dropping our calls over and over until we gave up. While my brother in law is a moron, he was a man in an electric wheelchair that was trapped in Vegas until his flight. We were nice, we conceded that my brother in law was a complete idiot. We just wanted to pay for his costs and get him back. I'm not sure why my wife wants him back, but there you go.  The capper on this entire thing? They charged our credit card for the resort fees for my brother in laws room, that they locked him out of.  We called around and found the La Quinta that was 1.5 miles down. We were not sure his electric wheelchair would get him there so my brother in law charged his electric wheelchair in the lobby and went to the La Quinta. He barely made it, slowly beeping and dragging wheels into their lobby. The La Quinta is supposed to be a low-end hotel, but damn if they didn't do literally everything possible to help out. They were nice on the phone. Let us know exactly how to pay, and even let GrubHub deliver to the lobby and bring it up the idiots room for him. They even loaned the moron a charge cord for his phone. They were the nicest, most helpful people ever. The MGM Grand? It was actually on my list for a place to stay for my 30th wedding anniversary when we were planning to fly down to renew our vows. Now? There is no way in hell I'd stay in the place because the staff were awful when there was a clear emergency.

And I'd like to let you know that I am completely disappointed in the level of customer service I received from Catherine, the manager that was at the check in counter. We stayed at your location to see the Ariana Grande Concert last night. Before leaving for the concert we turned the heater on so the room would be warm upon our return. When we got back to the room, this was not the case. Our room was at 68 degrees when we returned and continued to drop throughout the night. We tried turning the heater all the way up, as high as it could go and no hot air would come out. I called the front desk to double check that there should be heat in our room, and there should had been. We explained the situation and she asked if we wanted to have someone come look at it, being that it was past midnight and we were ready for bed, we asked if they could bring up extra blankets since we didn't know how long it would take for them to look at the heater. Upon checkout we explained the situation to the women, and I asked if we could have a partial credit since our heater was broken and we had to go through the night with no heat. This is when she grabbed her manager Catherine, and this is where everything went south for our stay. Instead of Catherine being empathetic and understanding, she took the stance of judgmental and accusatory. Catherine gave the excuse that because I chose not to have an engineer come to the room, that she would not be giving me any credit. It didn't matter to her how late it was. Nor did the front desk women that assisted us ever mention that I would forfeit being compensated because I'm not having the heater looked at. Catherine even said she could had moved us to a different room, as if making us pack up all of our stuff at midnight was a practical solution.Catherine's customer service skills are sub par and need to be looked into. Catherine gave a multitude of excuses as to what I should had done differently to why they need to have an engineer go check. Her reasons for why the engineer has to go check came off as though she'd rather assume I was lying rather than give me the benefit of the doubt and correct my unsatisfactory stay. Catherine also insulted my intelligence and said a reason an engineer needs to check is in case I don't know how to use a thermostat. I'm left wondering if these assumptions made by your extremely defensive manager is because I'm a minority and she's stereotyping me. I expect better from MGM Grand and I was left completely disappointed after this interaction. Your manager Catherine deeply needs sensitivity training. Catherine gave me the run around and minimized my issues and brushed them to the side. She said she'd have an engineer go look at the room and follow up with me today and that has still not happened, I've also sent an email to the hotel concierge and have also not heard anything, so now here I am leaving a review. I want this issue addressed. A customer should never have to be insulted and assumed to be a liar and treated as such when they bring an issue to the staff's attention.

They clearly have higher standards at bellagio and a few others but no longer at MGM. Booking direct and spending money is all they care about.

This hotel is a staple of the Las Vegas Strip. Think about the countless number of legendary boxing matches held at this hotel. The bright green lights projecting off of the side of the hotel at night. Everybody knows this is the MGM Grand just by looking at the green shade. The downside of the aesthetic is that the light is on all night long and you can't block it off in your room. If you're sensitive to light you might find it difficult to fall asleep here. The room shades on partially block out sunlight but the green light seeps right through. The hotel is pretty old but the room remain clean and organized. The only mishap I experience was a momentarily water shut off in my room. Yes, towards the end of my shower the water stream got weaker and weaker. Luckily I was almost done and not all soapy. Once I turned it off, it was unable to turn on again for at least an hour. Not sure what happened but definitely not something you would want your customers to experience at 9:00PM. Other than that, there are plenty of food selections in the lobby. They have anything from food court type restaurants to $100 per person high end type restaurants. I think this location is ideal for people attending events either at the MGM or Mandalay Bay. Otherwise they are at the south end of the strip and it's a bit of a walk to the other attractions in the center of the strip. There is a monorail at the hotel but it cost money.

But for those of us asthmatics, this was a nightmare, and I was wheezing literally within minutes.

I guess some of their clientele enjoys crude, misogynistic, off-putting political \"humor\", but my husband and I didn't and were happy to get out of there!  I also wouldn't recommend staying there if you have children who might see that stuff, either, as it's inappropriate for kids and unfortunately hard to avoid seeing as you walk down the hallway.  Your grandmother probably won't approve, either.Accessing their parking area is a nightmare, as is trying to get anywhere near the valet.  It's honestly so stressful, it's just not worth staying at a place with such extreme traffic snarls!  I didn't find traffic/valet access nearly as bad at other hotels on the strip, and I think this just boiled down to poor design in this case.Needless to say, this simply isn't the hotel-casino for me, or anyone else affected negatively by cigarette smoke!

My thinking was since I blew $1900.00 on concert tickets for Bocelli and our last trip into the T-Mobile arena was such a hassle staying elsewhere, we'd stay at the MGM Grand. Well first mistake if I had called I probably stayed at the Signature to avoid all the smokers and cowboys and of course I know people smoke but your air scrubbers are none existent. That's one hell of a mix of people opera and cowboys, I worked in Vegas for a few years with your RTC and PBR was always in January well missed this one, meaning the nationals, but of course it gets worse.Grand Arena: Your usher staff on the main floor well need some SERIOUS training. Were on the main floor seat 1 & 2 and of course understand we have to move to let folks get to their chairs. Floor section B, Row P seats 1&2. Show start time 8pm, actual 8:20 at 8:40 your usher blinded me with here LED flash light, then now listen and understand this she lets 2 drunks who are late, fowled mouthed enter to their sets which where 12 & 13, I only count 16 seat, this usher interrupted the entire row it was ridiculous, they should have entered from the other end, common sense, not your usher. I spoke to a supervisor and she asked what she could do. Well I said train your people. In a classical setting say such as our Phoenix symphony people are not allowed to sit during the show, only at a break are the allowed into their seats. This along with this drunks big mouth and your dumb usher was beyond belief for my wife and I. Let alone the rude people who were constantly talking during the show behind us which of course your usher could have asked them to quiet down as the filmed the concert with the light on their phone for at least 12-15 minutes, multiple times, just unreal more lights in our eyes. Took that usher, older blond usher who was pissed at the world to the end of the show to stop the filming, just a joke. Note: also one of your people up from at the VIP entrance who just started on some poor guy because I think he asked her to move so he could get onto the venue, she was really loud and rude. Writing this makes me think it was a dream, I'm 28 and went to a boxing match or MMA fight. What the hell is going on there? Also writing this I'm dropping your rating to a 3 for you it just not right or correct, except for our room was quite at least and normal room we lucked out there I think. I can tell you we will NEVER come back and spend our money no matter the cost elsewhere. This seems to be an issue at other venues we read about after our stay yesterday, even the Hollywood bowl people acted like they were at a football game as they did at your arena....Only Boston, my home town got good reviews, it's a shame I grew up well educated and with some sense of class. Oh yeah someone, AKA an usher maybe should tell the cowboys that were sitting on the floor that their big brimmed hats blocked other people's views, it was our lucky night not ours! only in Vegas.I'm coping and sharing this review everywhere I can, my wife will critique you on her own she is just as disgusted and will do the same with her review, it's all we got. She was unhappy in your billing process as well but go figure she's a Treasure dealing in millions daily, not a clerk at Circle K. I'm sure they will eventually come to your arena for classical music and drop coins. I'm sure their enjoying their big tax breaks and have the money.Emeril's Shaun sommelier and bar staff: Emeril you should be proud of your crew in Vegas they made up for a lousy evening of what should have been classical for Mr. Bocelli but MGM made sure they messed that up this past Saturday. First Emeril your wine selection was for lack of a better word one of the finest I've seen, please open a restaurant here in Scottsdale! You sommelier Shaun was just fantastic. The wine we asked for was not in stock and he pulled out a beautiful replacement and at a smaller costs which is always a plus. The wine was fantastic and so was your food! Hope to see you soon but it wont be in the MGM sorry, we'll see you on our travels sure thought I was at one of your places in Orlando years ago?

I ended up going over to the Wynn on my second day in Vegas where the crowds at the craps table were much more energetic. The crappiest thing is what they make their customers go through to call an Uber. For pretty much any other decent hotel on the strip you just go out the doors and jump in an Uber. At the MGM you have to walk downstairs down a huge hallway and then into the garage where I assume employee parking is and then go to a specific level for Uber pick ups. Probably takes 5 min but it's just annoying. Are these guys getting paid by the cabbies or something cuz you can still get cabs at the front entrance, just not Uber.

If you're looking for prices for the minibar you have to turn on the TV, which I personally find annoying. We helped ourselves by bringing a soft-sided cooler bag and filled it with ice from the ice machine (and we weren't alone with that idea, as the ice machine regularly was out of ice).The hotel itself is really GRAND. It will take you at least 15 minutes from your room to one of the exits of the hotel, if not more depending on where you're going and how many people are blocking the walkways.

After staying there on my most recent trip, I cannot give more than 1 star. -The property feels old and outdated. -Their uber pick up is close to a 15 minute walk from your guest room and is located on the second floor of a parking structure, which makes it super inconvenient for guests.-Never book a West Wing King - I was assigned a first floor room, which is dark, and lacked natural light. The hallway is also used as a passage to   quick cut to the strip, so there was a lot of noise.-The resort tries to squeeze every dime from you; they will ask you multiple times if you want to check-out late, but this is not out of courtesy. They want you to pay $30 extra to stay for an additional 2 hours. -When you store your luggage at their bell desk, the ticket says \"Gratuity Not Included;\" When you pay a $40+ resort fee, you would expect them to store your luggage without trying to squeeze more money from you. -The location of being on far end of the strip also doesn't help, vs. Bellagio or its neighbors that are right in the middle of the Strip, which allow you to explore both sides with more ease. The MGM tram also costs money.-The two things I liked about MGM Grand was their 1 Michelin Star restaurant: L'Atelier De Joe\u0308l Robuchon, and the Chinese concerts they put on with big stars.

The woman helping me was a little rude, but ended up giving me a complimentary 1pm check out. The next day, I left for my interview and my father went to go explore the town. He went back to the hotel around 10:30 and found our room open and housekeeping inside. He told her we hadn't checked out yet and called down to the front desk with her there so he could confirm. They confirmed our late checkout with the housekeeper there. My father then noticed his jacket was missing, so he asked about it and the housekeeper walked to her cart and pulled it out for him. He then noticed his phone charger was also missing and asked for it. She again returned to her cart and pulled it out. My father then got his things together so he could go out again. When he reached the elevator, he realized he had forgotten his wallet in the room so he returned for it. As soon as he arrived, the door was once again open with the housekeeper inside. He confronted her and she embarrassedly laughed, but no one was amused. I called MGM customer service that night to tell them of the event and they didn't really seem to care and offered me a refund on my resort fee.

Our room was \"down grated\" to a standard room with 2 queens instead of a Grand room with a king and a view. The view we had was of an ally with garbage blowing around everywhere. So that sucked! Yes they comped our hotel fees, but funny how the last time I dated with them I was told those fees can not be waived. Make up your mind. So we get to our down grated room and want to put our cold food items in the fridge. There is a nice sign inside saying that of you want to put anything in the fridge it will cost you $50 as well as take anything out. Awesome! We go out for the night, and do some gambling and what not and get back to our room late. I want to take a shower but there is no cold water. The water was too hot to shower in so I just splashed the water on me from a distance. Woke up the next morning with an 8am knock on the door for housekeeping, but early if you ask me, and since I was up, I tried to shower again. This time, only cold water. We called down to see if it would be fixed. Never saw anyone come but they claim he did. Don't believe that one bit. We went down to watch football and back up at 1pm and the room was still not clean. We went to watch the next set of game, and at 4pm still not cleaned. We left to get some food and finally at 6p they were 1/2 way cleaning our room. We came in and stayed for about 15 minutes and the house keeper left and didn't finish the room. No clean glasses, old towels left, no trash taken out, empty cups and bottles on tables and old food left. The next day was about the same. The pool at the MGM is a joke! 2 pools open with blown speakers on a Sunday day in November. Yes it's not pool season and would expect a party or anything, but that's not what was bad about it. We called down and were told the pool was busy today and all the cabanas and beds were sold and taken. So we got down there to about 500 people covering and filling 2 pools open. 500 people and 1 bathroom with 2 stand up and 1 sit down stall for men. The stall was a wreck with paper and mess all over it. There was a baby changing station left open with no amenities for it and a puddle of brown who knows what on it. So unacceptable. I'm pretty sure I'd code enforcement went in there and saw 1 bathroom for 500+ people they would shut it down. I was directed to another bathroom that was pad locked shut! Needless to say we left the pool right away. We went back to our still in cleaned room and changed and left to go anywhere but the MGM or any of their associate hotels. Too bad they own 1/2 the strip.  We went to check out and asked to speak with someone and we were directed to Katherine Corona the hotels Operations Manager, well one of them anyway. We discussed the issues with here and she said that she took care of our resort fees, but that was BS because the guy that checked us in did that for us because of the room down grade. Katherine did absolutely nothing for us except give us a very robotics and generic apology and offer us food coupons for the MGM. Why would I want to spend another dime with them let alone stay there any longer and eat. I was very disappointed in both the MGM and its staff.

Security first: Overall positive- safe in your room is large and easy to use. Security staff everywhere (more due to the Grammy's which was nice) they were even checking hotel doors making sure they were locked on my hallway. I was walking to my room one afternoon, I was worried something was wrong and was informed - \"no only checking and making sure doors were locked\". Also they were standing guard at every elevator entry today (day of Grammy's) which was super helpful- people trying to get up to floors without a key nonstop yesterday which was brutal. Staff- Were all very nice and professional and very helpful. Rooms- Sooo wish there was a coffee maker in the room- there is none and the two tiny Starbucks they have for this massive hotel never seemed to have less than 30-40 people in line ever (5:30am + always a massive line) so give up on coffee here. Frig in the room- fully stocked which means DO NOT take anything out and put your own items in there- they charge a restocking fee $50! Extra frig for $35 a day if you need it?!! Um what? Conference rooms were freezing all the time and no tissues in the conference room bathrooms at all. It was brutal to have a cold and use paper towels to sneeze with. :( Walked 16-18k steps everyday to get from room to conference room - that's how far the conference center is from your rooms so don't wear heels!!! Cleanliness was amazing! Thankfully the floors were spotless! I mean spotless- the reason this mattered to me was I had to walk in my bare feet from my room to the conference rooms on awards night (heels were killing me) - the floors were so clean I wasn't worried at all!

It started with the parking garage because it told us where the parking garage was and that it was $15 a day, but when we checked in the parking process was not told to us or that we would be billed on our room the $15 a day. So we ended up paying double for parking. The check-in process was easy and quick, but the first elevator would not let us exit on our floor and we tried as well as other patrons to get on our floor. We finally made it to our room and were able to get into the room easily. Where we started to unpack and walk around the room. I opened the mini-fridge and picked something up to look at it and read the can, which I put back, but later found out I was charged $40 plus a service charge. Since we spent 6 hours traveling we decided to rest in the room and order room service, which ended up having a service fee as well. That was fine, but was not told to us anywhere that we could find.The walls to this hotel were also very thin and we could hear everything that other people were doing in their rooms. And early every morning we were woken up by someone in the alley throwing trash away. For the cost of this hotel we would expect that the walls wouldn't have been so thin and being woken up by everything at all hours of the night. The next morning we woke up early to head to an exhibit and I started to notice that the blinds were duct taped, the tile by the shower was broken, and the mirror was melting on the inside, which I assume could be a fire hazard. We spent the rest of the day out of the room and came back to rest and sleep early because we had to head home on Sunday, October 27th. After we checked out, my account was charged an extra $114.20 on top of the deposit I put down a couple months ahead of time of $273 and then at check-in I was charged $586.51, when I was originally told through their website the estimated balance due on check-in would be $386.51. So I ended up being up charged more than I thought was going to happen. When I emailed them stating that about the bill the only response I got was an email with the attachment of the bill. There was nothing said about the upcharge or anything and if I would have known that they would end up charging more I wouldn't have gone through their website or even through this hotel.

I feel like the price listings here that mark the MGM as more reasonable than other strip-located hotels are here because of the West Wing rooms-- that may be so, but they are small pods with no real windows. The hotel caters to people who want to be \"on the strip\" in a famous-name hotel but aren't going to stay in their rooms. There are quirks that go along with a hotel that is clearly showing its age-- the phone system failed our first night, so a broken safe in our room couldn't be fixed. Fortunately the front desk was helpful enough to upgrade us to the Grand Tower, which is the only part of this hotel that conforms to the standards one would expect for the prices. Basically, my experience here is that it's yet another Vegas hotel on the strip that gives you little while charging a lot. Unless you're going to spend the money for the Waldorf Astoria or the Aria, I'd find a place off the strip which will be nicer for the same money. You can always take a cab to the strip.Vegas attracts extremely helpful and responsive staff, and the MGM Grand is no exception. But the problems in the hotel are out of their control. All they can do is make it a bit better.Another thing: if you like having your own food and drinks in the room fridge or enjoy waking up to the hotel room coffee, that's not an option here. You can't use the minibar fridge, and you must rent a fridge for $35/day from housekeeping if you need one. There is no in-room coffee maker.

The MGM Grand is one of the more budget friendly hotels on/near the strip, and though I don't usually shop Vegas hotels based on price, I brought my parents on this trip for their first visit, and didn't want the price of a room to scare them to death. One thing I completely forgot when booking the MGM was the property's fairly renown pool complex. Affordable Vegas hotel + epic pool complex = very large numbers of young, and sometimes pretty obnoxious patrons (many of them female walking around the lobby in thong bikinis with see thru wraps). Now, you may be reading this thinking \"WHAT?! JACKPOT!!\" and I would've been right there with you about 12-15 years ago, but that just isn't my scene anymore. If it's yours, then this is certainly the place for you. As for me, my girlfriend was there and I'm not trying to get murdered in Vegas. Check-in is a bit of a nightmare if you don't have the app, which I didn't download until later. The other hotels seem to have figured it out a little better. I highly recommend downloading the app, checking in in advance, and picking your keys up at the side desk dedicated to online check ins. The room itself was nice. We got upgraded to the Grand Tower at check-in, which is where you really want to be. I didn't completely grasp the hotel layout when I booked, and initially booked us in the West Wing. The West Wing is quite a walk from the front desk and hotel entrance (read: taxi/Uber pick up and drop off) and the views aren't nearly as nice. The West Wing is, however, closer to the exits that will take you to New York, New York and the rest of the strip, so prioritize. The shower had a bit of identity confusion and couldn't decide if it wanted to be hot or cold, and would alternate between lukewarm and scalding without being adjusted. I will say the mattress was amazing, pretty firm, and I slept very well despite the partying happening next door (same previously mentioned clientele). Who tf parties in a hotel room in Vegas?! No coffee in the rooms and the minibar prices will have you selling your children into slavery ($15 for peanut M&Ms). With no shortage of restaurants and bars, I recommend Tap, especially if you're looking to catch a game. And yes, you will pay NFL stadium prices for food and drinks. Lobby Bar is also a great place to relax and end a long night before heading up to your room. The shop around the corner had $12 Padron cigars that you can take into Lobby Bar to enjoy with a nice glass of scotch or bourbon. I remarked just a few hours after check-in that this would be the first and last time I stay at the MGM Grand. Not in a particularly negative way, but in a \"been there, done that\" train of thought. I still feel the same way. If you're ok with paying a bit more, there are much better places to stay, but if you like some of the things I complained about above, the MGM Grand could very well be your Mecca.

I booked one of the Stay Well suites for my mother and I when we went to visit her critically ill brother in a hospital in Vegas.

I cannot tell you how big of a mistake it was selecting MGM for our stay.  Frustrations started as soon as we checked in.  I asked for a wheelchair to take my mother, who's 81, up to our room.  People act like they never heard of such a thing.  I was directed to the bell desk for the request and then he showed me a kiosk to rent a scooter for our stay.  I told him I just to get her to the room, no scooter required for our stay since we planned to be a the hospital most of the time.  Then he went over to security to request an escort to the room with a wheelchair.  Okay, whatever!  We waited and waited and waited at least 30 minutes until security finally came over.  He then proceeded to tell my 81 year old mother the elevator wasn't that far and started to walk her towards the elevator.  I shouted where is the wheelchair and then he shot around the information desk and came back with one.  Incredible.Once we got in our room, there was no microwave, no small frig, no coffee maker...nothing was included for your convenience. So, I looked for a pamphlet that list places in the area to eat, like any normal hotel would have, nope...nothing.  We were so tired and hungry we decided to take a look at the in-room dining menu.  However, the prices were so ridiculous we refused to pay.  Ended up walking to Denny's for dinner to get us something to eat.  And that was just the first day there!I did get my mother to venture down into the casino for a little fun with the slot machines.  Nope, no fun there!  All that did was suck up a quick $80 bucks and she was done after that.  I came back to the casino a few times and never heard anyone getting a pay out.  They should at least let the customers have a little fun while they are there!  I had to fight at check out as well.  My mother was looking at all the items at the mini bar in the room and turned around as she pulled a little bottle out the rack and asked if everything was included with the room.  I quickly told her no and she sat the item back down.  At check out I was questioned if we drank the peach schnapps.  I told him no, that my mother was snooping around but put it back. He lectured how it is clearly posted and it was charged to the room.  I reiterated that we did not drink it and my mother didn't realize that after paying for the room we still would have to pay more for food/drink items in the room. He finally removed from the bill.  Then he was going to charge us for using the complimentary $30 food coupon for eating at the Grand Buffet the departure day, which apparently is not allowed.

The pool area on the other hand is very nice and offers lots of choices to sunbathe and play and the water in these pools was exceptional. I did try the Avenue Cafe, which was very basic and pricey, as well as some poolside fare, that was not at all tasty, or even made to order, And of course poolside lunch cost $45 with tax and tip. That hurts.I would basically only come here for a Convention or one of the top flight restaurants that are located in this complex. I do hope you enjoy it.

Went here with my friend for her birthday and it was a sh**show. First thing- who the hell designed this place? Uncomfortable patterns used side by side. Everything makes you uncomfortable to look at. Can't say ugly. Just severely disturbing? (As if that is better). Who places byzantine next to mondriant next to wood and marble?Everything is expensive but thats a given except we were charged a resort fee even though we checked in around 1am the morning of the following day but guess that doesn't matter because we are using the Pool/wifi/gym in spirit just not physically on the day. Also, no free fridge because f*k you from mgm grand. Gym is tiny (honestly didn't mind) but why have a message saying how many bottles of water you are saving when next to the dispenser you are providing plastic cups?? hypocrisy at its best. I'm just reaching before the good part.My friend and I both experienced skin issues - rashes for her, eye stuff from me. She asked the hotel if the pillows were down/feathers or not and they said no. Guess what? They were indeed feathers as she found out the day before we left when the feather end poked out of the pillow. Cool so they don't even know their own hotel. We wanted to change the room after the first night but was told that all the rooms are the same?? Everything smelled like cigarettes (probably recycled nasty air from the casino area) or bleach. As in all the towels (I had a lovely stained towel btw) sheets, silverware etc smelled like bleach. The water is gross but thats a vegas thing not a MGM thing so cool - one thing that isn't their fault. Now I would have made this two stars. Because the pool is chill and I LOVED their spa. And honestly, every server/waitress/bartender in the place was so nice and had such nice energy. Coming from ny you never see happy servers like this cracking jokes. BUT when my friend complained to her booking service about the experience at the hotel the booking service stated that the hotel told them they had no record of the calls (there was at least 3) and that my friend had refused an upgrade. LOL WHO WOULD REFUSE AN UPGRADE? So now we know the management at MGM Grand are also grand liars. There are plenty of other hotels you can spend an exorbitant amount of money on and regret later who may not gaslight you and lie so I suggest booking your vegas nights elsewhere. But seriously?

Then check out the MGM Grand and its pool! After arriving to enjoy a daybed, my party and I found the daybed next to us to be packed. A daybed of four was seated at least 10 people. Four of them were children under 10. One of them was a toddler that had a chorus of screams and hollers he wanted everyone to hear.A member of my party spoke to our host (Gary... or Garry?) to see if we could be moved. Understandably so, the place was booked. Except... we could see empty beds. And, according to policy, any guest that doesn't arrive by 11 AM forfeits their reservation. It was well after 11. So, we took it in stride, enjoyed the pool as much as we could, and noticed not long after that our devoted host was very attentive - to the bed next to us. I had to track him down two times to order drinks and to check out for the day. He checked on us once, but was by the bed next to us quite often, chatting and hobnobbing. Keep in mind, I had already paid his gratuity.Fast forward to a few days later (my wife and I wanted to wait for a guest to leave before we started \"causing trouble\"). I call the pool, speak to Sophia, and inquire about receiving a refund. We have a pleasant conversation, which ends with her saying she'll see what she can do. I missed her callback, but she went and called my wife (who's name wasn't on the reservation) to say they'll refund the tax and gratuity. When my wife explained further that the issue was more than just the host, things took an antagonistic turn.Sophia became rude, taunted my wife by saying that's all they're going to do, all refunds go through her, and there's no way we'll get anything else. When things grew a little more heated, my wife requested to speak to Sophia's manager. Sophia denied, saying he doesn't handle these matters (please, remember this for later). There was no resolution between my wife and Sophia. So, after hearing how the call was handled, I called back and immediately told Sophia I would need to speak to her manager. Magically, he was available to handle our matter.Except, his attitude wasn't quite in check. The moment he (Tim Mushi) answered the phone, he was belligerent. He had the same snotty attitude Sophia apparently had with my wife. It must be part of MGM management training. When I tried to get a point in, he became louder, pointing out that my wife was rude and threatened MGM Pool staff (by saying someone should be fired, which never happened). I had to get louder, at which point things dissolved. When I pressed to talk about the issues that happened at the pool, Tim was more concerned with the phone call that never should have happened and likely didn't happen the way he was told. So, because I didn't let him continue with his nonsense, he hung up.Fast forward 10 days, we get in contact with an MGM Customer Experience rep who sends an email stating they would be happy to find a different resort that's a better fit for us. Essentially, we're being told to not come back to the MGM Grand. So, I made a phone call and found that Tim had wiped his hands clean of the matter, is offering no refund (despite the original promise of a return on the gratuity and tax), and refuses to speak to us further. I pressed with the rep (who was quite pleasant) that we want the refund. At this point, it's the principle of how we were treated. It eventually comes down to us being able to get the refund, BUT we would be banned from ALL MGM properties. Over $30. Neither my wife nor I ever threatened a member of MGM staff. We never screamed. We never cursed. We simply demanded what was rightly owed to us. A fix for a miserable experience. Instead, we were given an ultimatum. ... of course, I took it. Who would want to give money to a company that puts such individuals in management positions anyway?

Upon check in our first room had a lamp that didn't work, which in an already poorly lit room made it difficult to see more than 2 feet in front of you, which would have resulted in my makeup coming out like a five year old's art project. We were quickly and seamlessly moved, which is where the customer service ended. When we moved rooms we were delighted to find all the lights worked now allowing a whopping 5 feet of visibility. From there, the experience was downhill. The room smelled. It wasn't vacuumed. The walls were as this as I aspire to be. Which resulted in us being woken up to the screaming and blaring music of the neighbors every morning. It wasn't all bad though because the noise forced us to get up and take in an unparalleled view of the cracked roof and what I suspect to be a maid's cart who threw it along with herself off the roof when she could no longer take the filth of the hotel. The room offered no amenities like most Vegas hotels do. No robes, slippers, shower caps, body wash or the like. The shower had drill holes in the walls. The room did offer a stocked fridge that left no room for anything guests may need to place in there such as medicine. One of the members in my group had diabetes, so we called and asked for a fridge for her insulin. We were told we could absolutely had one for a measly $35/night. When told we could provide proof of the medical condition we were still told it would be $35 a night. When asked if we could remove the items from the fridge in the room we were told we could and would be charged for all fhe items. We were additionally instructed it wasn't a temperature controlled fridge fit for storing medication. When we asked to speak to a manager about this we were told the manager \"was in bed sleeping.\" The blatant disregard for human life by the staff we interacted with was more disgusting than the hotel itself. The room service prices will cost you the same as attending one of the 5 star restaurants in Vegas and will be served in plastic containers and a brown bag as the hotel no longer brings anything in on plates or a table, which makes me feel better that in addition to the disregard for human life they equally disregard the waste of plastic and effects on the environment and ocean.

But over the last 3 consecutive times we have stayed here in a period of one year, we grow that much more frustrated with our experience here. During my most recent stay over the Labor Day weekend, we decided that this was our last time staying at the MGM. We checked on Friday (8/30) at around 7:30pm. We had reserved a king room and was told that the only available king rooms they had were on the 12th floor. When we got to our room, both rooms on each side were blasting music so loud that the walls felt like they were vibrating. Sure, this is Vegas and people want to party so I have no problems playing your music while you chill and get ready. But, call me old or whatever, I also want to get some sleep while I'm here! So I didn't want to risk not getting sleep, I called the front desk and asked for a room change. They were able to change my room to the 11th floor, and we actually ended up getting an even worse room!! Not only was the room SERIOUSLY showing it's age, but the strong smell of chemicals trying to cover up, what I believe used to be a smoking room, was too much. My sinuses started to hurt after being in there for 3 minutes. I immediately called the front desk AGAIN asking for another room change. At first they kept telling me that there were no other rooms, and that they would bring up some machine to get rid of the odor. But I'm pretty sure that wouldn't have helped the situation. After about 5 minutes, they finally moved us to a queen room on the 23rd floor. This room was better and we no longer cared that it wasn't a king room. We just wanted to start our night.I wish I could say that things got better, but they didn't. College kids screaming and yelling in the hallway at 4am, AC didn't really keep the room cool, and our clothes and sandals got stolen at the lazy river.My husband and I decided that it's not worth it to try and save some money, and will begin staying at either Aria, Cosmopolitan, or the Mirage where our experiences have been great each and every time we stay.Super disappointed with the MGM Grand.

On top of that, I got house keeping waking me up at 6AM , we were just getting in for some sleep! Then as we try to leave , they couldn't give us my car because of a lost ticket I never got! I had been using valet for the three days I stayed and no problem, I wanted to leave ASAP! It was a horrible experience. We wanted a nice room to celebrate an anniversary n all we got was issues from the moment we got there. We wanted a weekend to relax n just got stress. We were lied to when it came to what we were getting. The lady at reception who was checking us in said oh you know what I'll go ahead and upgrade you don't worry. The other rooms are more outdated, we'll get you a better room. She saw my girlfriend n I n I guess assumed we were friends or something and just gave us too beds. Unnecessary. The parking was also so rude. We came in the last night we brought our car through valet. The guy didn't give us a ticket. He just said oh you came here before so it's fine n he took our car n we didn't get any ticket. Next day we tried to get our car because we were checking out and we went through so much trying to get our car.

My biggest recent annoyance is they've changed their room service policy to a strictly \"to go\" packaged options. You spend a fortune on the upcharged items (yes they charged me $10 for a banana...) and then they can't even deliver the room service on a table? So you're left to either eat your food on the desk in room staring at the wall or in bed if you actually want to see your tv.

I was there with my Fiance this time as we were getting married there in Vegas. I thought you know it would be nice to get a STAY WELL room as it might make the experience more enjoyable. I was way off thinking this. The room was always hot, granted it was 105 plus daily, but that is no excuse not to be able to cool a room properly, I heard several people on the elevator complaining about this as well. Next thing was the electrical outlets, MGM this is 2019, I should not have to worry about my electronics staying plugged into an outlet all the time. The out lets are old, no plug will stay in them, people these days have Ipads, Tablets, Cell phones and every other device imaginable and want to keep them charged. Seriously invest some money into this problem. Not to mention as I was ironing some clothes the iron plug came out of the outlet every couple of minutes because it was so loose. I think people reading this get my point, very frustrating. So then we come to the laundry service, I put 3 pair pf pants in for the laundry service, the ticket said if I had it ready to go by 930 am I would get it back by 7 pm. I called laundry at 850 am said I had some laundry to pick up, well it was picked up at a little past 10 am. I did not get the laundry back until about 1 the next day and do you know the only reason I got it back then was because I called and asked where was my laundry that I should have had back the night before. So now lets talk about the STAY WELL room, they sure do make it sound like it is a great experience online, a real let down if you ask me. First it says online and I quote \"sink water purification filtration\" bad news MGM your water smells like sulfur coming out of the bathroom sink when you first turn it on. Then the Amenities goes on to give you this elaborate listing of how amazing everything is in the room. There is no way this room is worth the extra cost for what they say will make your stay more pleasing. MGM food trays with food on it sitting in the hallways 24 plus hours is definitely a no no when it come to cleanliness. Overall a bad experience to be honest I was a little embarrassed in front of my new bride to be as I had her thinking the MGM experience would be the best. Not to mention this was her first time in Vegas. We were planning on coming back and making this a yearly thing, it will not be MGM or any of their properties getting my money again.", "lang_code": "en", "author_avatar": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png", "author_url": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AJXbRiLEGTeeu02BA51deg", "author_name": "David B.", "meta_data": {"author_contributions": 1, "feedback": {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}}, "location": "Severn, MD", "response": null}, {"review_url": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mgm-grand-hotel-las-vegas-5?hrid=KwvkTn07tMNGypmZJq7MWg", "id": "KwvkTn07tMNGypmZJq7MWg", "date": "2019-08-27", "rating": 5, "review_title": "", "review_text": "Love the MGM.

They wanted to charge me $30 per day to rent a mini fridge or $50 to empty the minibar.  What the hell?!?!? I've stayed at at least eight hotels on the strip and I would recommend every single one, over this hotel. Even the Tropicana!! I will say that the shining stars of this hotel are their housekeeping staff. They were extraordinarily friendly and courteous and put a smile on my face with every hall passing. In summary: Overpriced food, rude management, unkempt, and just straight up LAME!!!!! Spend your money elsewhere.AAAAAND...I was just informed that one of my husband's coworker's kid STEPPED IN ACTUAL FECES INSIDE OF THE ACTUAL HOTEL HALLWAY THIS MORNING!!!!

There was also not enough space to hang more that 4 or 5 items as a room safe was placed in the same area taking up hanging space.  The shower dripped all day and the shower floor pooled water in a section of the floor for my entire stay.  The sink was not clean and was heavily chipped in certain spots not hiding it's age very well.  The placement of the bed in the room, no doubt to hide the fact that it is an extremely narrow room with Queen not King bed, prevented window access and the auto shade buttons did not work.  No modern conveniences like a mini fridge or single cup coffee maker either.  There was a large mirror in the walkway leading to my room as well as several floor to ceiling mirrors, six in total, contributing greatly to a dated 60-ish or 70-ish vibe.

When you login to their wifi, it shows there's a $50 credit that you can use towards breakfast and buffet.

He also said that the $50 will be charged to your bill and when we check out we get our credit back. However, when we went to the front desk to check out, we were met with cold attitude and not one, not two, but 3 charges of $50 from the buffet. Obviously, as a customer, this made us extremely confused and to be quite frank, pretty upset we were going to pay $150 of something that should've been complimentary. The lady called us the manager, and I have to say, with all due respect, that I did not like his attitude one bit. His main point being they couldn't waive the fee for us and that it was OUR FAULT we confirmed with the buffet, not the front desk, as apparently the buffet does not have access to the information of your stay. Obviously this is a miscommunication between their hotel, as we pointed out to the manager, but he ASSURED us that it was our miscommunication with the hotel. Through our minutes of talking back and forth, the only solution we got was to have one of the $50's waived. The thing that makes me the most upset is not that I had to pay what the hotel should've covered, per their own website, which i will link below, but their attitude was overbearing and it looked like they just wanted to place all the blame on the customer. Frankly, this is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, in terms of attitude and customer service. If you go to any other hotel this would never ever happen. I am so disappointed, and to have this happen on the last day of your visit really ruins your whole mood/trip. If you're thinking about going to this hotel, I would 100% suggest look elsewhere for a better deal and better customer service, which obviously MGM Grand lacks.

Virtually all of the lounge chairs have towels thrown on them, although those parties may have left hours ago. The staff doesn't go through and pick up abandoned towels, so there is rarely a place to lay. This place is all about them making money and giving very little attention to their customers.

They didn't have a clue to what was going on, sending us in circles and giving wrong information. We also had to call housekeeping every evening when we returned to our rooms due to getting no service. The housekeeper supervisor attempted to make it right by giving us a voucher stating the 4 of us could have $25 comp on drinks. We try to use them in places to find out if the ppl lease a space they are not part of MGM and the voucher was no good there, so we find a MGM bar order one drink each and when we go to order the second drink was told no this is only good for one drink per person. When we went into the Garden Arena for our functions it was so disorganized and we experienced the most rudest ushers I have ever seen. We did speak with a supervisor and reported specific situations. I have never been to a company convention that has paid good $$ for ur business to host them and been made to feel like a herd of cattle. There were a couple of ladies that greeted u at the door over those 4 days that were pleasant but that was it. This was the worst hospitality I have experienced in all my years in business. How can u be a high end convention hotel and only have a refrigerator full of expensive items with not room for a customer that is staying 3-4 days at a time and can't keep any of ur own perishable items. How can u have a bathroom with no exhaust fan??? No microwave no coffee maker.

First off, David Copperfield, I mean rarely anyone there talks about him nor does he have any shows going on, however there's a gigantic picture of the rich-ass dude so where the hell is this guy at?!
